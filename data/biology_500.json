In model Douglas-fir ecosystems maintained for five growing seasons, elevated temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) increased photosynthesis and increased C storage belowground but not aboveground. We hypothesized that interactions between N cycling and C fluxes through two main groups of microbes, mycorrhizal fungi (symbiotic with plants) and saprotrophic fungi (free-living), mediated ecosystem C storage. To quantify proportions of mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi, we measured stable isotopes in fungivorous microarthropods that efficiently censused the fungal community. Fungivorous microarthropods consumed on average 35% mycorrhizal fungi and 65% saprotrophic fungi. Elevated temperature decreased C flux through mycorrhizal fungi by 7%, whereas elevated CO2 increased it by 4%. The dietary proportion of mycorrhizal fungi correlated across treatments with total plant biomass (n = 4, r(2) = 0.96, P = 0.021), but not with root biomass. This suggests that belowground allocation increased with increasing plant biomass, but that mycorrhizal fungi were stronger sinks for recent photosynthate than roots. Low N content of needles (0.8-1.1 and A horizon soil (0.11 coupled with high C: N ratios of A horizon soil (25-26) and litter (36-48) indicated severe N limitation. Elevated temperature treatments increased the saprotrophic decomposition of litter and lowered litter C: N ratios. Because of low N availability of this litter, its decomposition presumably increased N immobilization belowground, thereby restricting soil N availability for both mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth. Although increased photosynthesis with elevated CO2 increased allocation of C to ectomycorrhizal fungi, it did not benefit plant N status. Most N for plants and soil storage was derived from litter decomposition. N sequestration by mycorrhizal fungi and limited N release during litter decomposition by saprotrophic fungi restricted N supply to plants, thereby constraining plant growth response to the different treatments.","keywords":["23 february 2007","ecosystem response","february 2007 accepted","food webs","global change","received 28 september 2006","revised version received 6","soil carbon","stable isotopes"],"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-2486.2007.01379.x","identifiers":{"issn":"13541013","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2486.2007.01379.x"},"stats":{"readers":19,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":63},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":37}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":37},{"name":"France","value":5},{"name":"Portugal","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":21},{"name":"Post Doc","value":16},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":16}]},"issue":"7","pages":"1386-1397","publication_outlet":"Global Change Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/c13-and-n15-in-microarthropods-reveal-little-response-of-douglasfir-ecosystems-to-climate-change\/","publisher":"BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","uuid":"bba032f0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"E A","surname":"Hobbie"},{"forename":"P T","surname":"Rygiewicz"},{"forename":"Mark G","surname":"Johnson"},{"forename":"A R","surname":"Moldenke"}],"title":"13 C and 15 N in microarthropods reveal little response of Douglas-fir ecosystems to climate change","volume":"13","year":2007,"categories":[34,49,32,21,201,52,43,41,209,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1304428991000,"group_id":1086371},{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1300465256000,"group_id":966611},{"profile_id":2831321,"date_added":1296507397000,"group_id":841351}],"oa_journal":false},"5000b820-6d06-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"1. In 1986 work began which led to the foundation of Pond Conservation, the UK NGO which promotes the conservation of ponds and other freshwater habitats. In 1989 the organization initiated the UK National Pond Survey (NPS) to provide baseline data on the biota and physico-chemical characteristics of ponds. 2. Survey data have been used to demonstrate the importance of small water bodies for freshwater plants and animals, to establish techniques for assessing the ecological status of ponds and to provide the basis for a new national pond monitoring network in the UK. 3. Comparisons with extensive river and lake datasets show that, at a UK level, ponds support slightly more macro invertebrate species than rivers, and more uncommon species. They support similar numbers of wetland plants to lakes. Farmland ponds generally have lower site diversity than rivers;, however, in terms of regional diversity they make a greater contribution than other aquatic habitats. 4. Although ponds are an important biodiversity resource, studies have shown that ponds outside nature reserves Lire significantly degraded: thus ponds in the lowlands supported only half the number of wetland plant species that would be expected in minimally impaired ponds. 5. The environmental factors most highly correlated with species number and rarity in minimally impaired ponds were area, isolation, PH (and the related chemical measures alkalinity, calcium, conductivity) and abundance of vegetation. 6. Studies of degraded ponds showed strong negative relationships between potentially damaging environmental factors (e.g. intensive land use, nutrient levels) and species richness and rarity. 7. Although considerable progress has been made in characterizing the plant and invertebrate assemblages of ponds, comparatively little is known about the way ponds function or how they are affected by management. Given the importance of ponds in maintaining aquatic biodiversity at the landscape scale, further research is needed on ponds in the catchment context.

Little is known, however, about the structure and richness of different fungal communities and the distribution of functional ecological groups (pathogens, saprobes and symbionts). Here, we assessed the fungal diversity in six different forest soils using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1). No less than 166 350 ITS reads were obtained from all samples. In each forest soil sample (4 g), approximately 30 000 reads were recovered, corresponding to around 1000 molecular operational taxonomic units. Most operational taxonomic units (81%) belonged to the Dikarya subkingdom (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). Richness, abundance and taxonomic analyses identified the Agaricomycetes as the dominant fungal class. The ITS-1 sequences (73%) analysed corresponded to only 26 taxa. The most abundant operational taxonomic units showed the highest sequence similarity to Ceratobasidium sp., Cryptococcus podzolicus, Lactarius sp. and Scleroderma sp. This study validates the effectiveness of high-throughput 454 sequencing technology for the survey of soil fungal diversity. The large proportion of unidentified sequences, however, calls for curated sequence databases. The use of pyrosequencing on soil samples will accelerate the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fungal communities in forest ecosystems.","identifiers":{"pmid":"19703112"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19703112","stats":{"readers":48,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":75},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":19},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":21},{"name":"Hong Kong","value":4},{"name":"Austria","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":27},{"name":"Post Doc","value":25},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":13}]},"issue":"2","pages":"449-456","publication_outlet":"New Phytologist","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/454-pyrosequencing-analyses-of-forest-soils-reveal-an-unexpectedly-high-fungal-diversity\/","uuid":"003ea0e0-6d06-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"M","surname":"Bu\u00e9e"},{"forename":"M","surname":"Reich"},{"forename":"C","surname":"Murat"},{"forename":"E","surname":"Morin"},{"forename":"R H","surname":"Nilsson"},{"forename":"S","surname":"Uroz"},{"forename":"F","surname":"Martin"}],"title":"454 Pyrosequencing analyses of forest soils reveal an unexpectedly high fungal diversity.","volume":"184","year":2009,"categories":[35,32,201,200,43,434,41,193,44,45,49,21,123,29,210,35],"groups":[{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1304428993000,"group_id":1086371},{"profile_id":4127461,"date_added":1302019397000,"group_id":927251},{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1300465260000,"group_id":966611},{"profile_id":393791,"date_added":1268033765000,"group_id":334431}],"oa_journal":false},"0c6c2a00-6d0a-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"An 8000-year record of palaeoproductivity, based on the chemical and chironomid stratigraphies from Lake P ij nne, S. Finland, was assessed with respect to known morphometric, climatic and anthropogenic events. A gradual trend of dystrophication and an associated decrease in aquatic production was detected during the Holocene, with the following exceptions: (1) high diatom and chironomid production around 80006000 cal yr BP, (2) eutrophication around 2000 cal yr BP, and (3) an anthropogenic signal during the last few decades. The changes in chironomid assemblages, before the past few decades, have mainly been shifts in concentration, but not in species composition. Variation in chironomid production was mainly explained by the accumulations of biogenic silicon, carbon and organic matter. Nutrient availability seems to be important in controlling biogenic silicon, which we use to infer past diatom production. The high production ca. 80006000 cal yr BP and the fluctuation in chironomid influx after ca. 2000 cal yr BP, however, were probably caused by the proposed warm\/dry and cold\/ wet conditions during these times, respectively. These results highlight the sensitivity of boreal shield lake ecosystems to climatic forcing. In contrast, the pronounced change in the morphometry of the basin around 7000 cal yr BP had little effect on the trophic state of the lake. The human-induced trophic change during the past few decades has affected the Lake P ij nne ecosystem to an extent never experienced before during the last 8000-years.","keywords":["biogenic silicon","boreal forests","chironomids","climatic controls","finland","nutrient geochemistry","palaeolimnology","sediments","trophic state"],"website":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/T884903435501064.pdf","stats":{"readers":6,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":50},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":33},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":17}],"country":[{"name":"Argentina","value":33},{"name":"Brazil","value":17},{"name":"Colombia","value":17}],"status":[{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":50},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":17},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":17}]},"issue":"3","pages":"271-294","publication_outlet":"Journal of Paleolimnology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/8000year-history-of-palaeoproductivity-in-a-large-boreal-lake\/","publisher":"Springer","uuid":"0c6c2a00-6d0a-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Arto","surname":"Itkonen"},{"forename":"Virpi","surname":"Marttila"},{"forename":"Jarmo J","surname":"Meril\u00e4inen"},{"forename":"Veli-Pekka","surname":"Salonen"}],"title":"8000-year history of palaeoproductivity in a large boreal lake","volume":"21","year":1999,"categories":[119,112,22,43,209],"oa_journal":false},"aa3e4290-fe50-11df-95f0-0024e8453de6":{"tags":["arsenic"],"abstract":"Life is mostly composed of the elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus.

The composition and origin of the coral fauna and other reef-associated taxa are assessed in the context of dispersal and vicariance hypotheses. A minimum variance cluster analysis using coral species presence-absence classification data at the 14 localities revealed three eastern Pacific reef-coral provinces: (1) equatorial - mainland Ecuador to Costa Rica, including the Galapagos and Cocos Islands; (2) northern - mainland Mexico and the Revillagigedo Islands; (3) island group - eastern Pacific Malpelo Island and Clipperton Atoll, and central Pacific Hawaiian, Johnston and Fanning Islands. Coral species richness is relatively high in the equatorial (17-26 species per locality) and northern (18-24 species) provinces, and low at two small offshore island localities (7-10 species). A high proportion (36.6%, 15 species) of eastern Pacific coral species occurs at only one or two localities; of these, three disappeared following the 1982-83 ENSO event, three occur as death assemblages at several localities, and five are endangered with known populations of ten or fewer colonies. Principal component analysis using ordinal relative density data for the 41 species at the 14 localities indicated three main species groupings, i.e., those with high, mid, and narrow spatial distributions. These groupings correlated with species population-dynamic characteristics. These results were compared with data for riverine discharges, ocean circulation patterns, shoreline habitat characteristics, and regional sea surface temperature data to help clarify the analyses as these measures of environmental variability affect coral community composition. Local richness was highest at localities with the highest environmental variability. Recent information regarding the strong affinity between eastern and central Pacific coral faunas, abundance of teleplanic larvae in oceanic currents, high genetic similarity of numerous reef-associated species, and appearances of numerous Indo-west Pacific species in the east Pacific following ENSO activity, suggest the bridging of the east Pacific filter bridge (formerly east Pacific barrier).","keywords":["although its","biogeography \u00e1 eastern paci","c \u00e1","crucial role","e","ecology obviously plays a","ects cannot detected","faunas","compilations entire","zooxanthellate corals"],"website":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/openurl.asp?genre=article&id=doi:10.1007\/s003380050220","identifiers":{"pmid":"151","issn":"07224028","doi":"10.1007\/s003380050220"},"stats":{"readers":40,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":80},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":15},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":28},{"name":"Portugal","value":8},{"name":"Colombia","value":10}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":28},{"name":"Post Doc","value":20},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":10}]},"issue":"1","pages":"1-23","publication_outlet":"Coral Reefs","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-biogeographic-analysis-and-review-of-the-far-eastern-pacific-coral-reef-region\/","publisher":"Springer","uuid":"c0c46c10-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"P W","surname":"Glynn"},{"forename":"J S","surname":"Ault"}],"title":"A biogeographic analysis and review of the far eastern Pacific coral reef region","volume":"19","year":2000,"categories":[119,35,201,39,203,37,52,43,40,208,210,44],"groups":[{"profile_id":3284091,"date_added":1293340751000,"group_id":757041},{"profile_id":233292,"date_added":1259185078000,"group_id":56022},{"profile_id":233292,"date_added":1257984338000,"group_id":532301}],"oa_journal":false},"ea8ae410-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["molecular dynamics","gromos"],"abstract":"Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time.

Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.","identifiers":{"pmid":"15264259"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15264259","stats":{"readers":58,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":43},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":34},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":7}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":21},{"name":"Portugal","value":5},{"name":"Hong Kong","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":33},{"name":"Post Doc","value":24},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":12}]},"issue":"13","pages":"1656-1676","publication_outlet":"Journal of Computational Chemistry","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-biomolecular-force-field-based-on-the-free-enthalpy-of-hydration-and-solvation-the-gromos-forcefield-parameter-sets-53a5-and-53a6\/","uuid":"ea8ae410-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Chris","surname":"Oostenbrink"},{"forename":"Alessandra","surname":"Villa"},{"forename":"Alan E","surname":"Mark"},{"forename":"Wilfred F","surname":"Van Gunsteren"}],"title":"A biomolecular force field based on the free enthalpy of hydration and solvation: the GROMOS force-field parameter sets 53A5 and 53A6.","volume":"25","year":2004,"categories":[518,519,101,381,43,193,284,85,119,187,462,80,82,455,454,27,385,391,331,392],"groups":[{"profile_id":4697241,"date_added":1303982636000,"group_id":1074251},{"profile_id":1705161,"date_added":1299596806000,"group_id":938321},{"profile_id":1705161,"date_added":1280323098000,"group_id":369181}],"oa_journal":false},"31db56d0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed \"bivalent domains,\" consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16630819","identifiers":{"pmid":"16630819"},"stats":{"readers":169,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":88},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":8},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"","value":1},{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":27}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":40},{"name":"Post Doc","value":18},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":10}]},"issue":"2","pages":"315-326","public_file_hash":"ff83e83d3917795d63ec2bafc6f3e0030022bad3","publication_outlet":"Cell","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-bivalent-chromatin-structure-marks-key-developmental-genes-in-embryonic-stem-cells\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"31db56d0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Bradley E","surname":"Bernstein"},{"forename":"Tarjei S","surname":"Mikkelsen"},{"forename":"Xiaohui","surname":"Xie"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Kamal"},{"forename":"Dana J","surname":"Huebert"},{"forename":"James","surname":"Cuff"},{"forename":"Ben","surname":"Fry"},{"forename":"Alex","surname":"Meissner"},{"forename":"Marius","surname":"Wernig"},{"forename":"Kathrin","surname":"Plath"},{"forename":"Rudolf","surname":"Jaenisch"},{"forename":"Alexandre","surname":"Wagschal"},{"forename":"Robert","surname":"Feil"},{"forename":"Stuart L","surname":"Schreiber"},{"forename":"Eric S","surname":"Lander"}],"title":"A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.","volume":"125","year":2006,"categories":[35,101,38,99,67,43,348,193,44,326,462,48,80,455,27,28,331,31,30,35,352],"groups":[{"profile_id":3336941,"date_added":1301626485000,"group_id":981141},{"profile_id":1037021,"date_added":1298759345000,"group_id":913071},{"profile_id":3163451,"date_added":1295456144000,"group_id":791131},{"profile_id":3048621,"date_added":1290696336000,"group_id":688881},{"profile_id":30963,"date_added":1285976683000,"group_id":444421},{"profile_id":202292,"date_added":1265984937000,"group_id":123181}],"oa_journal":false},"956ab470-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["forensic entomology"],"abstract":"Apart from an early case report from China (13th century) and later artistic contributions, the first observations on insects and other arthropods as forensic indicators were documented in Germany and France during mass exhumations in the late 1880s by Reinhard and Hofmann, whom we propose recognizing as co-founders of the discipline. After the French publication of M gnin's popular book on the applied aspects of forensic entomology, the concept quickly spread to Canada and the US. At the time, researchers recognized that the lack of systematic observations of forensically important insects stood in the way of their use as indicators of postmortem interval. General advances in insect taxonomy, and ecology helped close this gap over the following decades. Many early case reports dealt with alleged child homicides, including the suspected use of sulphuric acid. In this context, it was shown that ants, cockroaches, and freshwater arthropods could produce postmortem artifacts suggestive of child abuse. After the World Wars, few forensic entomology cases entered the scientific literature. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Leclecq and Nuorteva were primarily responsible for maintaining the method in Central Europe, with a focus on case work. Since then, basic research in the US, Russia and Canada has opened the way to the routine use of entomology in forensic investigations. The following article gives a brief overview of historic developments in the field. A major focus is on the work done between 1850 and 1950. Since sources from that time remain difficult to track down, the article also includes a historic bibliographical overview on forensic entomology of that era.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11457602","identifiers":{"pmid":"11457602"},"stats":{"readers":41,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":88},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":5},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":10},{"name":"","value":2},{"name":"Portugal","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":27},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":27},{"name":"Other Professional","value":10}]},"issue":"1-2","pages":"2-14","publication_outlet":"Forensic Science International","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-brief-history-of-forensic-entomology\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"956ab470-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"M","surname":"Benecke"}],"title":"A brief history of forensic entomology.","volume":"120","year":2001,"categories":[32,21,414,80,52,43,330,331,44,32,219],"groups":[{"profile_id":21559,"date_added":1248291056000,"group_id":3442},{"profile_id":13432,"date_added":1245052494000,"group_id":2166},{"profile_id":13881,"date_added":1243363218000,"group_id":1829}],"oa_journal":false},"93df5220-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["tlr"],"abstract":"An emerging paradigm in innate immune signalling is that cell biological context can influence the outcome of a ligand-receptor interaction.

Blood-borne ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) activates the behavioral sequence through direct actions on the central nervous system. RESULTS: To elucidate neural substrates underlying the ecdysis sequence, we identified neurons expressing ETH receptors (ETHRs) in Drosophila. Distinct ensembles of ETHR neurons express numerous neuropeptides including kinin, FMRFamides, eclosion hormone (EH), crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), myoinhibitory peptides (MIP), and bursicon. Real-time imaging of intracellular calcium dynamics revealed sequential activation of these ensembles after ETH action. Specifically, FMRFamide neurons are activated during pre-ecdysis; EH, CCAP, and CCAP\/MIP neurons are active prior to and during ecdysis; and activity of CCAP\/MIP\/bursicon neurons coincides with postecdysis. Targeted ablation of specific ETHR ensembles produces behavioral deficits consistent with their proposed roles in the behavioral sequence.

Our results suggest that all three major classes of bactericidal drugs can be potentiated by targeting bacterial systems that remediate hydroxyl radical damage, including proteins involved in triggering the DNA damage response, e.g., RecA.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17803904","identifiers":{"pmid":"17803904"},"stats":{"readers":112,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":86},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":4},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":38},{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"Estonia","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":45},{"name":"Post Doc","value":13},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":9}]},"issue":"5","pages":"797-810","publication_outlet":"Cell","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-common-mechanism-of-cellular-death-induced-by-bactericidal-antibiotics\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"34d81c10-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Michael A","surname":"Kohanski"},{"forename":"Daniel J","surname":"Dwyer"},{"forename":"Boris","surname":"Hayete"},{"forename":"Carolyn A","surname":"Lawrence"},{"forename":"James J","surname":"Collins"}],"title":"A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.","volume":"130","year":2007,"categories":[35,351,43,78,161,41,44,187,462,80,320,159,25,455,27,28,331,210,329,35,350],"groups":[{"profile_id":3635031,"date_added":1297269859000,"group_id":867171},{"profile_id":3635031,"date_added":1297252720000,"group_id":866281},{"profile_id":3165951,"date_added":1292696101000,"group_id":723851},{"profile_id":2750691,"date_added":1288630515000,"group_id":630061},{"profile_id":1298741,"date_added":1271732788000,"group_id":222781},{"profile_id":497661,"date_added":1264072914000,"group_id":95141}],"oa_journal":false},"42164eb0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"We conducted a comparative analysis to determine life history and ecological correlates of pollen limitation among 224 species of animal-pollinated flowering plants. To test predictions concerning the occurrence of pollen limitation, species were classified categorically for six life-history traits (self-compatible vs. self-incompatible, autogamous vs. non-autogamous, specialized vs. unspecialized floral morphology, nectariferous vs. nectarless, monocarpic vs. polycarpic, herbaceous vs. woody) and two ecological conditions (presence in open vs. forested habitats and temperate vs. tropical biomes). Pollen limitation of species in contrasting categories was compared using non-parametric tests (TIPs analysis) and phylogenetically- independent contrasts (PICs). The results of TIPs and PICs analyses were generally congruent, although fewer significant contrasts were evident with PICs, probably because of low statistical power. Overall the results suggest that the influence of phylogenetic history on the intensity of pollen limitation was not particularly strong. Nonetheless, significant variation in the degree of pollen limitation was demonstrated among seven angiosperm families suggesting some phylogenetic component to the phenomenon. With both TIPs and PICs, pollen limitation was less intense in self-compatible and autogamous species. TIPs analysis demonstrated that herbaceous, nectariferous, and temperate species were less likely to be pollen-limited, but using PICs this could only be corroborated for those that were self-incompatible. None of the traits were singularly unambiguous predictors of pollen limitation, possibly reflecting the stochastic nature of pollinator service.","website":"http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/journal\/119036748\/abstract","identifiers":{"issn":"00244066","doi":"10.1006\/bijl.1999.0372"},"stats":{"readers":44,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":91},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":7},{"id":9,"name":"Education","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":16},{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"Costa Rica","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Post Doc","value":18},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":11}]},"issue":"4","pages":"503-520","publication_outlet":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-comparative-analysis-of-pollen-limitation-in-flowering-plants\/","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","uuid":"42164eb0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"B M H","surname":"Larson"},{"forename":"Spencer C H","surname":"Barrett"}],"title":"A comparative analysis of pollen limitation in flowering plants","volume":"69","year":2000,"categories":[152,35,32,48,201,43,29],"groups":[{"profile_id":27624,"date_added":1284405033000,"group_id":440691},{"profile_id":2233301,"date_added":1282626553000,"group_id":408041},{"profile_id":2083361,"date_added":1282626553000,"group_id":544821}],"oa_journal":false},"7b68d660-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"issn":"00301299","doi":"10.2307\/3544689"},"website":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3544689?origin=crossref","stats":{"readers":13,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":92},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":8}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":23},{"name":"Canada","value":8},{"name":"Spain","value":8}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":31},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":23},{"name":"Post Doc","value":8}]},"issue":"3","pages":"288","publication_outlet":"Oikos","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-comparative-analysis-of-soil-fauna-populations-and-their-role-in-decomposition-processes\/","uuid":"7b68d660-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Henning","surname":"Petersen"},{"forename":"Malcolm","surname":"Luxton"}],"title":"A Comparative Analysis of Soil Fauna Populations and Their Role in Decomposition Processes","volume":"39","year":1982,"categories":[49,32,52,43,41,210],"oa_journal":false},"57851aa0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"1. Apart from downstream dispersal through invertebrate drift, few quantitative data are available to model the dispersal of stream invertebrates, i.e. the outward spreading of animals from their point of origin or release. The present study provides comparative data for 10 species, using two independent methods: unmarked animals in six stream channels built over a stony stream and marked animals in the natural stream. Experiments were performed in April and June 1973 and 1974, with initial numbers of each species varying from 20 to 80 in the stream channels and 20 to 60 for marked animals. 2. Results were the same for marked invertebrates and those in the channels. Dispersal was not density-dependent; the number of dispersing animals was a constant proportion of the initial number for each species. The relationship between upstream or downstream dispersal distance and the number of animals travelling that distance was well described by an inverse power function for all species (exponential and log models were poorer fits). Results varied between species but were similar within species for the 4 months, and therefore were unaffected by variations in mean water velocity (range 0.04-0.35 m s(-1)) or water temperature (range 6.7-8.9 degreesC in April, 12.1-14.8 degreesC in June). 3. Species were arranged in order, according to their dispersal abilities. Three carnivores (Perlodes, Rhyacophila, Isoperla) dispersed most rapidly (70-91% in 24 h, maximum distances 9.5-13.5 m per day), followed by two species (Protonemura, Rhithrogena) in which about half their initial numbers dispersed (50-51% in 24 h, 7.5-8 m per day), and four species (Ecdyonurus, Hydropsyche, Gammarus, Baetis) in which less than half dispersed (33-40% in 24 h, 5.5-7 m per day). Dispersal was predominantly upstream for all nine species. Few larvae (20%) of Potamophylax dispersed, with similar maximum upstream and downstream distances of 3.5 m per day. The mean time spent drifting downstream was known for seven species from previous studies, and correlated positively with their dispersal distances. Therefore, the species formed a continuum from rapid to very slow dispersers. These interspecific differences should be considered when evaluating the role of dispersal in the maintenance of genetic diversity in stream invertebrates, and in their ability to colonise or re-colonise habitats","keywords":["ephemeroptera","gammarus","invertebrate drift","plecoptera","trichoptera"],"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1046\/j.1365-2427.2003.01117.x","identifiers":{"issn":"00465070","doi":"10.1046\/j.1365-2427.2003.01117.x"},"stats":{"readers":24,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":75},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":17},{"id":9,"name":"Education","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":25},{"name":"France","value":4},{"name":"Czech Republic","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":21},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":21},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":17}]},"issue":"9","pages":"1652-1668","publication_outlet":"Freshwater Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-comparative-study-of-the-dispersal-of-10-species-of-stream-invertebrates\/","uuid":"57851aa0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"J M","surname":"Elliott"}],"title":"A comparative study of the dispersal of 10 species of stream invertebrates","volume":"48","year":2003,"categories":[32,201,39,37,43,79,148,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":173312,"date_added":1256764102000,"group_id":29402}],"oa_journal":false},"6bd82410-6d07-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"We examined the relative merits of mitochondrial DNA loci and ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers for their use in prospecting for cryptic species of platyhelminth parasites. Sequence divergence at ITS1 and ITS2 was compared with divergence at 2 mtDNA loci (NADH dehydrogenase-1 and cytochrome c oxidase I) between closely related species of trematodes and cestodes. Both spacers accumulated substitutions substantially more slowly than mtDNA, which clearly shows a higher level of divergence among species relative to intra-specific variation. Besides a slow rate of substitution, other caveats that may be encountered when using ITS sequences as a prospecting marker are discussed. In particular, we note recent studies that suggest the existence of substantial levels of intra-individual variation in ITS sequences of flatworms. Because it is likely that closely related species share this phenomenon, it may confound the detection of cryptic species, especially if small sample sizes are studied. Although potential limitations of mtDNA are also recognized, the higher rate of evolution and smaller effective population size of this marker increases the probability of detecting diagnostic characters between cryptic species.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16336737","identifiers":{"pmid":"16336737"},"stats":{"readers":10,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":90},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":10}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":10},{"name":"France","value":10},{"name":"Brazil","value":30}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":40},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":30},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":20}]},"issue":"Pt 6","pages":"839-846","publication_outlet":"Parasitology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-comparison-between-mitochondrial-dna-and-the-ribosomal-internal-transcribed-regions-in-prospecting-for-cryptic-species-of-platyhelminth-parasites\/","publisher":"Cambridge Univ Press","uuid":"6bd82410-6d07-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"R","surname":"Vilas"},{"forename":"C D","surname":"Criscione"},{"forename":"M S","surname":"Blouin"}],"title":"A comparison between mitochondrial DNA and the ribosomal internal transcribed regions in prospecting for cryptic species of platyhelminth parasites.","volume":"131","year":2005,"categories":[36,43,47,210,35,47],"oa_journal":false},"6b2e9a70-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of intravenous (IV) and extradural (ED) methadone on end-tidal isoflurane concentration (Fe'ISO) and postoperative analgesic requirements in dogs undergoing femoro-tibial joint surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, clinical study. Animals Twenty-four healthy client-owned dogs undergoing surgical repair of ruptured cruciate ligaments. METHODS: Dogs were randomly assigned to two groups of 12 animals and received either ED or IV methadone (0.3 mg kg(-1) diluted with saline to 0.2 mL kg(-1)). Pre-anaesthetic medication was IV acepromazine (0.05 mg kg(-1)). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained initially with an Fe'ISO of 1.0% delivered in oxygen. Methadone was injected with the dogs in sternal recumbency; the observer was unaware of the administration route. At 10 minutes (stimulation 1) and 20 minutes (stimulation 2) after methadone administration pelvic limb reflexes were tested by digit-clamping. The time at skin incision (stimulation 3), joint-capsule incision (stimulation 4), tibial tuberosity drilling (stimulation 5), fabellar suturing (stimulation 6) and extracapsular tightening (stimulation 7) were noted. Changes in heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate and arterial blood pressure associated with surgery were recorded along with the corresponding Fe'ISO. After 20 minutes of anaesthesia, Fe'ISO was decreased to the minimum required to maintain stable anaesthesia. Immediately after tracheal extubation, 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours postoperatively and on the morning after surgery, the degree of pain present was assessed using a numerical rating scale. The HR, respiratory rates and blood pressure were also recorded at these times. Serum cortisol and blood glucose concentrations were measured before pre-anaesthetic medication and at each postoperative pain scoring interval except at 1 and 2 hours. Ketoprofen (2 mg kg(-1)), carprofen (4 mg kg(-1)) or meloxicam (0.2 mg kg(-1)) were given by subcutaneous injection whenever pain scoring indicated moderate discomfort was present. RESULTS: Controlled ventilation was required in six dogs which stopped breathing after IV methadone. The median Fe'ISO at stimulus 5 was 1.0% in the IV and 0.83% in the ED group. At stimulus 6, Fe'ISO was 1.0% in the IV and 0.8% in the ED group; the difference was statistically significant (p 0.05). There was no significant difference in the duration of postoperative analgesia associated with administration route. CONCLUSIONS: Extradural methadone significantly reduces the isoflurane requirement compared with IV methadone during femoro-tibial joint surgery in dogs.

Rabbits were 12.7 9.8 months old with body mass 2.24 0.61 kg. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, blinded clinical trial. METHODS: Ketamine (15 mg kg(-1)) and midazolam (3 mg kg(-1)) or medetomidine (0.25 mg kg(-1)) were administered by intramuscular (IM) injection. Ten minutes after IM injection, blind intubation of the trachea was attempted. The time taken, the number of attempts and a subjective score of the ease of intubation were recorded. Isoflurane (range 0-3.6%) in 100% oxygen was delivered via a Jackson Rees modification of an Ayre's T-piece non-rebreathing system. Carprofen (3 mg kg(-1)) and dextrose saline (5 mL kg(-1) hour(-1)) were administered intravenously (IV). During surgery heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and arterial oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (SpO(2)) were monitored. Times to extubation and first head lift were recorded. Group KMT received atipamezole (0.5 mg kg(-1)) IM 30 minutes after discontinuation of isoflurane. Activity was scored at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after volatile agent discontinuation. Mean time to loss of righting reflex (LRR), body mass, RR and vaporizer setting were compared using a two-tailed t-test. Median values for all other data were compared using a Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean time to LRR (+\/-SD) was significantly shorter with KMT (1.64 0.55 minutes) compared with KMZ (2.28 0.66 minutes). Intubation was not possible in seven rabbits (three with KMT, four with KMZ) and three with KMT developed laryngospasm. Mean HR, SpO(2) and vaporizer settings were all significantly lower in group KMT.

This was based on the analysis of three genes (cytochrome oxidase II, 12S and 28S) and worker characters for approximately 250 species of termites. Parsimony analysis of the aligned dataset showed that the monophyly of Hodotermitidae, Kalotermitidae and Termitidae were well supported, while Termopsidae and Rhinotermitidae were both paraphyletic on the estimated cladogram. Within Termitidae, the most diverse and ecologically most important family, the monophyly of Macrotermitinae, Foraminitermitinae, Apicotermitinae, Syntermitinae and Nasutitermitinae were all broadly supported, but Termitinae was paraphyletic. The pantropical genera Termes, Amitermes and Nasutitermes were all paraphyletic on the estimated cladogram, with at least 17 genera nested within Nasutitermes, given the presently accepted generic limits. Key biological features were mapped onto the cladogram. It was not possible to reconstruct the evolution of true workers unambiguously, as it was as parsimonious to assume a basal evolution of true workers and subsequent evolution of pseudergates, as to assume a basal condition of pseudergates and subsequent evolution of true workers. However, true workers were only found in species with either separate- or intermediate-type nests, so that the mapping of nest habit and worker type onto the cladogram were perfectly correlated. Feeding group evolution, however, showed a much more complex pattern, particularly within the Termitidae, where it proved impossible to estimate unambiguously the ancestral state within the family (which is associated with the loss of worker gut flagellates). However, one biologically plausible optimization implies an initial evolution from wood-feeding to fungus-growing, proposed as the ancestral condition within the Termitidae, followed by the very early evolution of soil-feeding and subsequent re-evolution of wood-feeding in numerous lineages.","identifiers":{"pmid":"17625919"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17625919","stats":{"readers":19,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":89},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":5},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":21},{"name":"France","value":16},{"name":"Brazil","value":26}],"status":[{"name":"Associate Professor","value":26},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":26},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":16}]},"issue":"3","pages":"953-967","publication_outlet":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-comprehensive-phylogenetic-analysis-of-termites-isoptera-illuminates-key-aspects-of-their-evolutionary-biology\/","uuid":"5abf68a0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Daegan J G","surname":"Inward"},{"forename":"Alfried P","surname":"Vogler"},{"forename":"Paul","surname":"Eggleton"}],"title":"A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of termites (Isoptera) illuminates key aspects of their evolutionary biology.","volume":"44","year":2007,"categories":[424,32,52,43,41,210,35,352],"groups":[{"profile_id":2615611,"date_added":1304435831000,"group_id":600251},{"profile_id":3961761,"date_added":1299689505000,"group_id":939031},{"profile_id":88932,"date_added":1282613984000,"group_id":407921},{"profile_id":2000201,"date_added":1282252374000,"group_id":403421},{"profile_id":11409,"date_added":1269743096000,"group_id":569391}],"oa_journal":false},"ed705b50-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Climatic variation and change affect the dynamics of organisms and ecosystem processes.

Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable 'core microbiome' at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19043404","identifiers":{"nihms_id":"74182","pmid":"19043404","pmc_id":"2677729"},"stats":{"readers":141,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":77},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":12},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":45},{"name":"Taiwan","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":15},{"name":"Post Doc","value":14}]},"issue":"7228","pages":"480-484","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-core-gut-microbiome-in-obese-and-lean-twins\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"dd873ee0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Peter J","surname":"Turnbaugh"},{"forename":"Micah","surname":"Hamady"},{"forename":"Tanya","surname":"Yatsunenko"},{"forename":"Brandi L","surname":"Cantarel"},{"forename":"Alexis","surname":"Duncan"},{"forename":"Ruth E","surname":"Ley"},{"forename":"Mitchell L","surname":"Sogin"},{"forename":"William J","surname":"Jones"},{"forename":"Bruce A","surname":"Roe"},{"forename":"Jason P","surname":"Affourtit"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Egholm"},{"forename":"Bernard","surname":"Henrissat"},{"forename":"Andrew C","surname":"Heath"},{"forename":"Rob","surname":"Knight"},{"forename":"Jeffrey I","surname":"Gordon"}],"title":"A core gut microbiome in obese and lean twins.","volume":"457","year":2009,"categories":[35,101,201,338,336,402,43,434,41,44,48,21,352,322,52,455,335,298,385,331,28,210,35,291,352,429,338,41,423],"groups":[{"profile_id":1483801,"date_added":1306088124000,"group_id":1137301},{"profile_id":3299611,"date_added":1300069394000,"group_id":952341},{"profile_id":3368781,"date_added":1295255749000,"group_id":782171},{"profile_id":2710781,"date_added":1289377295000,"group_id":640541},{"profile_id":2639881,"date_added":1288212070000,"group_id":619371},{"profile_id":31729,"date_added":1286740513000,"group_id":573861},{"profile_id":535391,"date_added":1282632317000,"group_id":405521},{"profile_id":629131,"date_added":1280770335000,"group_id":377731},{"profile_id":95262,"date_added":1275885709000,"group_id":16872},{"profile_id":577691,"date_added":1269287924000,"group_id":517581},{"profile_id":499551,"date_added":1268430081000,"group_id":94411},{"profile_id":508841,"date_added":1265634989000,"group_id":116751},{"profile_id":497661,"date_added":1264072914000,"group_id":95141},{"profile_id":351661,"date_added":1263228929000,"group_id":83471}],"oa_journal":false},"a93dcd90-6d08-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"We report herein the development of a pepper genetic linkage map which comprises 299 orthologous markers between the pepper and tomato genomes (including 263 conserved ortholog set II or COSII markers).

However, recent developmental and palaeontological discoveries suggest a more complex scenario of limb reduction, still poorly documented in the fossil record. Here we report a fossil snake with a sacrum supporting a pelvic girdle and robust, functional legs outside the ribcage. The new fossil, from the Upper Cretaceous period of Patagonia, fills an important gap in the evolutionary progression towards limblessness because other known fossil snakes with developed hindlimbs, the marine Haasiophis, Pachyrhachis and Eupodophis, lack a sacral region. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the new fossil is the most primitive (basal) snake known and that all other limbed fossil snakes are closer to the more advanced macrostomatan snakes, a group including boas, pythons and colubroids. The new fossil retains several features associated with a subterranean or surface dwelling life that are also present in primitive extant snake lineages, supporting the hypothesis of a terrestrial rather than marine origin of snakes.","identifiers":{"pmid":"16625194"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16625194","stats":{"readers":45,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":82},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":13},{"id":14,"name":"Law","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":16},{"name":"Ghana","value":2},{"name":"Canada","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":20},{"name":"Professor","value":16},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":13}]},"issue":"7087","pages":"1037-1040","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-cretaceous-terrestrial-snake-with-robust-hindlimbs-and-a-sacrum\/","uuid":"446cf370-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Sebasti\u00e1n","surname":"Apestegu\u00eda"},{"forename":"Hussam","surname":"Zaher"}],"title":"A Cretaceous terrestrial snake with robust hindlimbs and a sacrum.","volume":"440","year":2006,"categories":[32,37,43,40,119,48,23,113,52,249,121,210,31,352],"oa_journal":false},"44ab42b0-6d06-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"Since the first generation of a negative-sense RNA virus entirely from cloned cDNA in 1994, similar reverse genetics systems have been established for members of most genera of the Rhabdo- and Paramyxoviridae families, as well as for Ebola virus (Filoviridae). The generation of segmented negative-sense RNA viruses was technically more challenging and has lagged behind the recovery of nonsegmented viruses, primarily because of the difficulty of providing more than one genomic RNA segment. A member of the Bunyaviridae family (whose genome is composed of three RNA segments) was first generated from cloned cDNA in 1996, followed in 1999 by the production of influenza virus, which contains eight RNA segments. Thus, reverse genetics, or the de novo synthesis of negative-sense RNA viruses from cloned cDNA, has become a reliable laboratory method that can be used to study this large group of medically and economically important viruses. It provides a powerful tool for dissecting the virus life cycle, virus assembly, the role of viral proteins in pathogenicity and the interplay of viral proteins with components of the host cell immune response. Finally, reverse genetics has opened the way to develop live attenuated virus vaccines and vaccine vectors.","identifiers":{"pmid":"12388800"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12388800","stats":{"readers":14,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":86},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":14}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":50},{"name":"France","value":7},{"name":"Colombia","value":7}],"status":[{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":21},{"name":"Post Doc","value":14},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":14}]},"issue":"Pt 11","pages":"2635-2662","publication_outlet":"The Journal of general virology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decade-after-generation-negativesense-rna-virus-cloned-cdnawhat-we-learned\/","uuid":"44ab42b0-6d06-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"Gabriele","surname":"Neumann"},{"forename":"Michael A","surname":"Whitt"},{"forename":"Yoshihiro","surname":"Kawaoka"}],"title":"A decade after the generation of a negative-sense RNA virus from cloned cDNA - what have we learned?","volume":"83","year":2002,"categories":[51,43,27,331,44,35,352],"oa_journal":false},"e1ee57a0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Diatom assemblages preserved in sediment cores from closed-basin lakes can provide high-resolution records of past hydrologic and climatic conditions, including long-term patterns in the intensity, duration, and frequency of droughts.

In particular, the question of where mountain species survived the ice ages has been approached in many phylogeographical studies. The terminology of glacial refugia of mountain species is often confusing, contradictory or counter-intuitive. Our aim is to clarify and simplify this terminology. First, we offer a general definition of the term glacial refugium for mountain species. Then, we discuss three main types of glacial refugia of mountain species, i.e. nunatak, peripheral and lowland refugia. We believe that the discrimination of these three types of glacial refugia is sufficient to describe the glacial survival of (most) mountain species. Finally, we argue that the terms in situ survival and ex situ survival and the term periglacial refugium should only be used to describe specific cases of glacial history. No simple classification system can adequately describe every kind of glacial refugium, but we propose that authors should focus on providing comprehensive descriptions of particular refugial situations instead of introducing new terminology.","keywords":["alpine","correspondence","ex situ survival","ice ages","situ survival","lowland refugia","nunatak","peripheral refugia","refugia","rolf holderegger","wsl swiss"],"website":"http:\/\/blackwell-synergy.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2008.02027.x","identifiers":{"issn":"03050270","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2008.02027.x"},"stats":{"readers":36,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":94},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":3},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":14},{"name":"Portugal","value":6},{"name":"Ghana","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":42},{"name":"Post Doc","value":22},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":14}]},"issue":"3","pages":"476-480","publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-discussion-of-different-types-of-glacial-refugia-used-in-mountain-biogeography-and-phylogeography\/","uuid":"c8048050-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Rolf","surname":"Holderegger"},{"forename":"Conny","surname":"Thiel-Egenter"}],"title":"A discussion of different types of glacial refugia used in mountain biogeography and phylogeography","volume":"36","year":2009,"categories":[201,52,43,29,121],"groups":[{"profile_id":415581,"date_added":1262960209000,"group_id":499581}],"oa_journal":false},"38b36b10-6501-11e0-a2d8-0024e8453de6":{"tags":["ifn"],"abstract":"The type I interferon response protects cells against invading viral pathogens. The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.","website":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nature09907","identifiers":{"pmid":"21478870","issn":"00280836","doi":"10.1038\/nature09907"},"stats":{"readers":30,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":90},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":7},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":7},{"name":"United States","value":33},{"name":"Belgium","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":37},{"name":"Post Doc","value":20},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":17}]},"issue":"7344","pages":"481-485","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diverse-range-gene-products-effectors-type-i-interferon-antiviral-response\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"38b36b10-6501-11e0-a2d8-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"John W","surname":"Schoggins"},{"forename":"Sam J","surname":"Wilson"},{"forename":"Maryline","surname":"Panis"},{"forename":"Mary Y","surname":"Murphy"},{"forename":"Christopher T","surname":"Jones"},{"forename":"Paul","surname":"Bieniasz"},{"forename":"Charles M","surname":"Rice"}],"title":"A diverse range of gene products are effectors of the type I interferon antiviral response","volume":"1","year":2011,"categories":[51,38,455,43,28,331,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":4863441,"date_added":1305781001000,"group_id":1129681},{"profile_id":4863441,"date_added":1305726256000,"group_id":1127381},{"profile_id":4634081,"date_added":1303372006000,"group_id":1058931},{"profile_id":8340,"date_added":1302694366000,"group_id":770501}],"oa_journal":false},"eb434550-6d06-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"DNA barcoding involves sequencing a standard region of DNA as a tool for species identification.

In this plasmid-based expression system, viral cDNA is inserted between the RNA polymerase I (pol I) promoter and terminator sequences. This entire pol I transcription unit is flanked by an RNA polymerase II (pol II) promoter and a polyadenylation site. The orientation of the two transcription units allows the synthesis of negative-sense viral RNA and positive-sense mRNA from one viral cDNA template. This pol I-pol II system starts with the initiation of transcription of the two cellular RNA polymerase enzymes from their own promoters, presumably in different compartments of the nucleus. The interaction of all molecules derived from the cellular and viral transcription and translation machinery results in the generation of infectious influenza A virus. The utility of this system is proved by the recovery of the two influenza A viruses: A\/WSN\/33 (H1N1) and A\/Teal\/HK\/W312\/97 (H6N1). Seventy-two hours after the transfection of eight expression plasmids into cocultured 293T and MDCK cells, the virus yield in the supernatant of the transfected cells was between 2 x 10(5) and 2 x 10(7) infectious viruses per milliliter. We also used this eight-plasmid system for the generation of single and quadruple reassortant viruses between A\/Teal\/HK\/W312\/97 (H6N1) and A\/WSN\/33 (H1N1). Because the pol I-pol II system facilitates the design and recovery of both recombinant and reassortant influenza A viruses, it may also be applicable to the recovery of other RNA viruses entirely

Their results showed dismayingly low average statistical power (note that a meta-analytic review of statistical power is different from post hoc power analysis as criticized in Hoenig and Heisey, 2001). The statistical power of a null hypothesis (Ho) significance test is the probability that the test will reject Ho when a research hypothesis (Ha) is true. Knowledge of effect size is particularly important for statistical power analysis (for statistical power analysis, see Cohen, 1988; Nakagawa and Foster, in press). There are many kinds of effect size measures available (e.g., Pearson's r, Cohen's d, Hedges's g), but most of these fall into one of two major types, namely the r family and the d family (Rosenthal, 1994). The r family shows the strength of relationship between two variables while the d family shows the size of difference between two variables. As a benchmark for research planning and evaluation, Cohen (1988) proposed conventional values for small, medium, and large effects: r =.10,.30, and.50 and d =.20,.50, and.80, respectively (in the way that p values of.05,.01, and.001 are conventional points, although these conventional values of effect size have been criticized; e.g., Rosenthal et al., 2000). The meta-analysis on statistical power by Jennions and M ller (2003) revealed that, in the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, statistical power of less than 20% to detect a small effect and power of less than 50% to detect a medium effect existed. This means, for example, that the average behavioral scientist performing a statistical test has a greater probability of making a Type II error (or (i.e., not rejecting Ho when Ho is false; note that statistical power is equals to 1 than if they had flipped a coin, when an experiment effect is of medium size (i.e., r =.30, d =.50). Here, I highlight and discuss an implication of this low statistical power on one of the most widely used statistical procedures, Bonferroni correction (Cabin and Mitchell, 2000). Bonferroni corrections are employed to reduce Type I errors (i.e., rejecting Ho when Ho is true) when multiple tests or comparisons are conducted. Two kinds of Bonferroni procedures are commonly used. One is the standard Bonferroni procedure, where a modified significant criterion (\/k where k is the number of statistical tests conducted on given data) is used. The other is the sequential Bonferroni procedure, which was introduced by Holm (1979) and popularized in the field of ecology and evolution by Rice (1989) (see these papers for the procedure). For example, in a recent volume of Behavioral Ecology (vol. 13, 2002), nearly one-fifth of papers (23 out of 117) included Bonferroni corrections. Twelve articles employed the standard procedure while 11 articles employed the sequential procedure (10 citing Rice, 1989, and one citing Holm, 1979). A serious problem associated with the standard Bonferroni procedure is a substantial reduction in the statistical power of rejecting an incorrect Ho in each test (e.g., Holm, 1979; Perneger, 1998; Rice, 1989). The sequential Bonferroni procedure also incurs reduction in power, but to a lesser extent (which is the reason that the sequential procedure is used in preference by some researchers; Moran, 2003). Thus, both procedures exacerbate the existing problem of low power, identified by Jennions and M ller (2003). For example, suppose an experiment where both an experimental group and a control group consist of 30 subjects. After an experimental period, we measure five different variables and conduct a series of t tests on each variable. Even prior to applying Bonferroni corrections, the statistical power of each test to detect a medium effect is 61% (=.05), which is less than a recommended acceptable 80% level (Cohen, 1988). In the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, it is usually difficult to use large sample sizes (in many cases, n < 30) because of practical and ethical reasons (see Still, 1992). When standard Bonferroni corrections are applied, the statistical power of each t test drops to as low as 33% (to detect a medium effect at \/5 =.01). Although sequential Bonferroni corrections do not reduce the power of the tests to the same extent, on average (3361% per t test), the probability of making a Type II error for some of the tests = 1 power, so 3966%) remains unacceptably high. Furthermore, statistical power would be even lower if we measured more than five variables or if we were interested in detecting a small effect. Bonferroni procedures appear to raise another set of problems. There is no formal consensus for when Bonferroni procedures should be used, even among statisticians (Perneger, 1998). It seems, in some cases, that Bonferroni corrections are applied only when their results remain significant. Some researchers may think that their results are more significant if the results pass the rigor of Bonferroni corrections, although this is logically incorrect (Cohen, 1990, 1994; Yoccoz, 1991). Many researchers are already reluctant to report nonsignificant results (Jennions and M ller, 2002a,b). The wide use of Bonferroni procedures may be aggravating the tendency of researchers not to present nonsignificant results, because presentation of more tests with nonsignificant results may make previously significant results nonsignificant under Bonferroni procedures. The more detailed research (i.e., research measuring more variables) researchers do, the less probability they have of finding significant results. Moran (2003) recently named this paradox as a hyper-Red Queen phenomenon (see the paper for more discussion on problems with the sequential method). Imagine that we conduct a study where we measure as many relevant variables as possible, 10 variables, for example. We find only two variables statistically significant. Then, what should we do? We could decide to write a paper highlighting these two variables (and not reporting the other eight at all) as if we had hypotheses about the two significant variables in the first place. Subsequently, our paper would be published. Alternatively, we could write a paper including all 10 variables. When the paper is reviewed, referees might tell us that there were no significant results if we had appropriately employed Bonferroni corrections, so that our study would not be advisable for publication. However, the latter paper is scientifically more important than the former paper. For example, if one wants to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate an overall effect in a specific area of study, the latter paper is five times more informative than the former paper. In the long term, statistical significance of particular tests may be of trivial importance (if not always), although, in the short term, it makes papers publishable. Bonferroni procedures may, in part, be preventing the accumulation of knowledge in the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, thus hindering the progress of the field as science. However, it is true that researchers often seem to measure apparently irrelevant variables in their study, unnecessarily expanding a probability of making Type I errors. Therefore, it is understandable that reviewers sometimes have to demand Bonferroni corrections for such studies. As explained above, the use of Bonferroni procedures further reduce power, increasing a Type II error to unacceptable levels, and they may also contribute to publication bias, hindering the advance of the field. Therefore, the use of Bonferroni corrections and the practice of reviewers demanding Bonferroni procedures should be discouraged (and also, researchers should play their part in carefully selecting relevant variables in their study). These problems probably stem from overemphasis on statistical significance (i.e., p values) in journals rather than more emphasis on practical or biological significance (i.e., effect size) (Cohen, 1990). I recommend routine presentation of observed (standardized) effect size, such as Pearson's r and Cohen's d, in journal articles (r and d are readily convertible; Rosenthal, 1994), as also recommended by Stoehr (1999) and Jennions and M ller (2003)(see these papers for various benefits of reporting effect size; see also Kirk, 1996). Standardized effect sizes are degrees of experimental effects, which are comparable across studies even with different sample sizes (note that p values do not tell us what degree of experimental effect is present; Cohen, 1990, 1994; Yoccoz, 1991). Thus, reporting observed effect size, along with exact p values, allows readers as well as researchers to evaluate the biological importance (and statistical significance) of results. Although presenting standardized effect size is still not common in ecology and evolution, some journals in other disciplines oblige or strongly recommend researchers to present effect size (e.g., Murphy, 1997; Wilkinson and The Task Force on Statistical Inference, 1999). Furthermore, reporting not only effect sizes but also confidence intervals (CIs) for effect sizes may prove more useful (see Thompson, 2002, and references therein for software that calculates CIs for effect sizes), because the CIs for effect sizes can be used to interpret nonsignificant results (see Hoenig and Heisey, 2001; Colegrave and Ruxton, 2003; Jennions and M ller, 2003; Nakagawa and Foster, in press). Additionally, if research involves a large number of variables, controlling false discovery rate (FDR; the proportion of rejecting true Hos; cf., Bernoulli equation in Moran, 2003) may be an option rather than controlling the probability of obtaining even one false rejection of Ho (i.e., using Bonferroni corrections), as Garc a (2003)recently highlighted.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) (ref. 2) and elongation factor Tu receptor (EFR) (ref. 3) act as pattern-recognition receptors for the bacterial PAMPs flagellin and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) (ref. 5) and contribute to resistance against bacterial pathogens. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that link receptor activation to intracellular signal transduction. Here we show that BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1), a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase that has been reported to regulate the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 (refs 6,7), is involved in signalling by FLS2 and EFR. Plants carrying bak1 mutations show normal flagellin binding but abnormal early and late flagellin-triggered responses, indicating that BAK1 acts as a positive regulator in signalling. The bak1-mutant plants also show a reduction in early, but not late, EF-Tu-triggered responses. The decrease in responses to PAMPs is not due to reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids. We provide evidence that FLS2 and BAK1 form a complex in vivo, in a specific ligand-dependent manner, within the first minutes of stimulation with flagellin. Thus, BAK1 is not only associated with developmental regulation through the plant hormone receptor BRI1 (refs 6,7), but also has a functional role in PRR-dependent signalling, which initiates innate immunity.","identifiers":{"pmid":"17625569"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17625569","stats":{"readers":42,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":95},{"id":2,"name":"Astronomy \/ Astrophysics \/ Space Science","value":2},{"id":1,"name":"Arts and Literature","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":7},{"name":"Hong Kong","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":33},{"name":"Post Doc","value":19},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":17}]},"issue":"7152","pages":"497-500","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-flagellininduced-complex-of-the-receptor-fls2-and-bak1-initiates-plant-defence\/","uuid":"8ebd3150-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Delphine","surname":"Chinchilla"},{"forename":"Cyril","surname":"Zipfel"},{"forename":"Silke","surname":"Robatzek"},{"forename":"Birgit","surname":"Kemmerling"},{"forename":"Thorsten","surname":"N\u00fcrnberger"},{"forename":"Jonathan D G","surname":"Jones"},{"forename":"Georg","surname":"Felix"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Boller"}],"title":"A flagellin-induced complex of the receptor FLS2 and BAK1 initiates plant defence.","volume":"448","year":2007,"categories":[16,35,48,21,8,43,44,35,38],"groups":[{"profile_id":3844931,"date_added":1306391340000,"group_id":1147341},{"profile_id":4806471,"date_added":1306161420000,"group_id":1086071},{"profile_id":4345551,"date_added":1301684201000,"group_id":1005061},{"profile_id":3607851,"date_added":1296563460000,"group_id":843411}],"oa_journal":false},"edcc56a0-6d05-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"1. The potential of using stable isotope signatures of avian claws in order to infer diet and habitat use was investigated. 2. Highly significant relationships observed between stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (13C, 15N) in the claws and body feathers of resident birds were expected since it was predicted that they were synthesized in the same habitat and approximately the same time of year. 3. Likewise the non-significant relationships observed between 13C and 15N in the claws and tertial feathers of neotropical migrant birds were also predicted since the claws were synthesized in the wintering area and the tertials in the breeding area. 4. The growth rates measured in the claws of five species of palearctic passerines provide evidence that this tissue should integrate dietary and habitat information over a medium temporal scale (probably weeks to months). 5.

We provide examples of classification procedures in data-rich and data-poor regions from the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest of North America and the upper Paraguay River in central South America.

We present an unconventional procedure (fuzzy coding) to structure biological and environmental information, which uses positive scores to describe the affinity of a species for different modalities (i.e. categories) of a given variable. Fuzzy coding is essential for the synthesis of long-term ecological data because it enables analysis of diverse kinds of biological information derived from a variety of sources (e.g. samples, literature). 2. A fuzzy coded table can be processed by correspondence analysis. An example using aquatic beetles illustrates the properties of such a fuzzy correspondence analysis. Fuzzy coded tables were used in all articles of this issue to examine relationships between spatial-temporal habitat variability and species traits, which were obtained from a long-term study of the Upper Rhone River, France. 3. Fuzzy correspondence analysis can be programmed with the equations given in this paper or can be performed using ADE (Environmental Data Analysis) software that has been adapted to analyse such long-term ecological data. On Macintosh Apple(TM) computers, ADE performs simple linear ordination, more recently developed methods (e.g. principal component analysis with respect to instrumental variables, canonical correspondence analysis, co-inertia analysis, local and spatial analyses), and provides a graphical display of results of these and other types of analysis (e.g. biplot, mapping, modelling curves). 4.

National gap analyses are an important step in describing and addressing this problem, so we sought to determine the representativeness of English PAs devoted to biodiversity conservation by using Natural Areas (NAs), elevation and PA boundary data. We found that National Nature Reserves (NNRs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interests (SSSIs) cover only 6.3% of England and are generally small, with respective median areas of 1.1 and 0.2 km2. The English PA system under-represents lowland areas and provides a median level of 2.5% protection for the NA types, with seventy nine per cent of NA types having less than 10% protection. Therefore, we suggest that England's PA system needs to be expanded, although this would probably entail modification of existing legislation to increase involvement by landowners.

However, their model is known to be less successful when applied to systems and processes operating on evolutionary and geological timescales. Here, we present a general dynamic model (GDM) of oceanic island biogeography that aims to provide a general explanation of biodiversity patterns through describing the relationships between fundamental biogeographical processes - speciation, immigration, extinction - through time and in relation to island ontogeny. Location Analyses are presented for the Azores, Canaries, Galapagos, Marquesas and Hawaii. Methods We develop a theoretical argument from first principles using a series of graphical models to convey key properties and mechanisms involved in the GDM. Based on the premises (1) that emergent properties of island biotas are a function of rates of immigration, speciation and extinction, (2) that evolutionary dynamics predominate in large, remote islands, and (3) that oceanic islands are relatively short-lived landmasses showing a characteristic humped trend in carrying capacity (via island area, topographic variation, etc.) over their life span, we derive a series of predictions concerning biotic properties of oceanic islands. We test a subset of these predictions using regression analyses based largely on data sets for native species and single-island endemics (SIEs) for particular taxa from each archipelago, and using maximum island age estimates from the literature. The empirical analyses test the power of a simple model of diversity derived from the GDM: the log(Area) + Time + Time(2) model (ATT(2)), relative to other simpler time and area models, using several diversity metrics. Results The ATT(2) model provides a more satisfactory explanation than the alternative models evaluated (for example the standard diversity-area models) in that it fits a higher proportion of the data sets tested, although it is not always the most parsimonious solution. Main conclusions The theoretical model developed herein is based on the key dynamic biological processes (migration, speciation, extinction) combined with a simple but general representation of the life cycle of oceanic islands, providing a framework for explaining patterns of biodiversity, endemism and diversification on a range of oceanic archipelagos. The properties and predictions derived from the model are shown to be broadly supported (1) by the empirical analyses presented, and (2) with reference to previous phylogenetic, ecological and geological studies.","keywords":["correspondence","diversification","diversity theory","dynamic model","equilibrium theory","extinction rate","general","island biogeography","island evolution","island life cycle","robert j","speciation","whittaker"],"website":"http:\/\/www.blackwell-synergy.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2008.01892.x","identifiers":{"issn":"03050270","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2008.01892.x"},"stats":{"readers":97,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":85},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":13},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":21},{"name":"Portugal","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":30},{"name":"Post Doc","value":14},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":13}]},"issue":"6","pages":"977-994","publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-general-dynamic-theory-of-oceanic-island-biogeography\/","publisher":"[Oxford, Eng.] Blackwell Scientific Publications","uuid":"beaf47b0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Robert J","surname":"Whittaker"},{"forename":"Kostas A","surname":"Triantis"},{"forename":"Richard J","surname":"Ladle"}],"title":"A general dynamic theory of oceanic island biogeography","volume":"35","year":2008,"categories":[35,32,201,203,37,43,40,46,47,119,48,52,123,29,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":958951,"date_added":1301092692000,"group_id":57961},{"profile_id":1547841,"date_added":1298247297000,"group_id":896311},{"profile_id":1498731,"date_added":1289243066000,"group_id":590591},{"profile_id":649151,"date_added":1276807911000,"group_id":317451},{"profile_id":237292,"date_added":1273495010000,"group_id":528591}],"oa_journal":false},"f2e5a200-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"There is debate concerning the most effective conservation of marine biodiversity, especially regarding the appropriate location, size, and connectivity of marine reserves.

This quantitative approach provides a powerful tool for decision-makers tasked with siting marine reserves.","identifiers":{"pmid":"12471258"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12471258","stats":{"readers":79,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":65},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":28},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":35},{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"Philippines","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":34},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":13}]},"issue":"5600","pages":"1991-1993","publication_outlet":"Science","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-general-model-for-designing-networks-of-marine-reserves\/","uuid":"f2e5a200-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Enric","surname":"Sala"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Aburto-Oropeza"},{"forename":"Gustavo","surname":"Paredes"},{"forename":"Ivan","surname":"Parra"},{"forename":"Juan C","surname":"Barrera"},{"forename":"Paul K","surname":"Dayton"}],"title":"A general model for designing networks of marine reserves.","volume":"298","year":2002,"categories":[35,32,201,39,203,37,43,434,40,119,457,159,52,335,208,209,210,120,237,208],"groups":[{"profile_id":2999671,"date_added":1297800069000,"group_id":883371},{"profile_id":3337701,"date_added":1295437785000,"group_id":806921},{"profile_id":554231,"date_added":1266993223000,"group_id":138061}],"oa_journal":false},"d5674760-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Allometric scaling relations, including the 3\/4 power law for metabolic rates, are characteristic of all organisms and are here derived from a general model that describes how essential materials are transported through space-filling fractal networks of branching tubes.

These complaints largely are unjustified. The components of a general theory of ecology have existed for the past half century; ecologists simply have failed to explicitly recognize them. We present a general theory of ecology and show how it relates to ecology's numerous constituent theories and models. The general theory consists of a description of the domain of ecology and a set of fundamental principles. The domain of ecology is the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences. Fundamental principles are broad statements about the patterns that exist and the processes that operate within a domain. The seven fundamental principles of the theory of ecology are: the heterogeneous distribution of organisms, interactions of organisms, contingency, environmental heterogeneity, finite and heterogeneous resources, the mortality of organisms, and the evolutionary cause of ecological properties. These principles are the necessary and sufficient elements for a general theory of ecology. The propositions of any constituent theory of ecology can be shown to be a consequence of these fundamental principles along with principles from other science domains. The general theory establishes relationships among constituent theories through shared fundamental principles. The next challenge is to develop and integrate unified, constituent theories and to establish the relationships among them within the framework established by the general theory.","keywords":["conceptual framework","law","model","theory"],"website":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s12080-007-0002-0","pages":"21-28","public_file_hash":"68cb2004739084f88d08b9eafd443e43332f44cb","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-general-theory-of-ecology\/","volume":"1","categories":[204,201,39,36,203,37,43,40,46,44,119,49,48,23,52,364,296,26,29,148,210]},"30a5e410-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"This paper describes a stand growth model, based on physiological processes, which incorporates a number of steps and procedures that have allowed considerable simplification relative to extant process-based models. The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; P-G) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation( phi(p.a.u.)), obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy (phi(p.a.)) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. P-G is obtained from phi(p.a.u.) and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (P-N) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate P-N-the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios-widely available for many species and situations-to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations (self-thinning) are derived from a procedure based on the -3\/2 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stem diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.

Conversely, auxin mediates degradation of the SHY2 protein, sustaining PIN activities and cell division.

Protein activity has been controlled by light, through protein derivatization with photocleavable moieties or using photoreactive small-molecule ligands. However, this requires use of toxic ultraviolet wavelengths, activation is irreversible, and\/or cell loading is accomplished via disruption of the cell membrane (for example, through microinjection). Here we have developed a new approach to produce genetically encoded photoactivatable derivatives of Rac1, a key GTPase regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics in metazoan cells. Rac1 mutants were fused to the photoreactive LOV (light oxygen voltage) domain from phototropin, sterically blocking Rac1 interactions until irradiation unwound a helix linking LOV to Rac1. Photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1) could be reversibly and repeatedly activated using 458- or 473-nm light to generate precisely localized cell protrusions and ruffling. Localized Rac activation or inactivation was sufficient to produce cell motility and control the direction of cell movement. Myosin was involved in Rac control of directionality but not in Rac-induced protrusion, whereas PAK was required for Rac-induced protrusion. PA-Rac1 was used to elucidate Rac regulation of RhoA in cell motility. Rac and Rho coordinate cytoskeletal behaviours with seconds and submicrometre precision. Their mutual regulation remains controversial, with data indicating that Rac inhibits and\/or activates Rho. Rac was shown to inhibit RhoA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with inhibition modulated at protrusions and ruffles. A PA-Rac crystal structure and modelling revealed LOV-Rac interactions that will facilitate extension of this photoactivation approach to other proteins.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19693014","identifiers":{"nihms_id":"129300","pmid":"19693014","pmc_id":"2766670"},"stats":{"readers":68,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":78},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":12},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":40},{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"Austria","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":38},{"name":"Post Doc","value":18},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":10}]},"issue":"7260","pages":"104-108","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-genetically-encoded-photoactivatable-rac-controls-the-motility-of-living-cells\/","publisher":"Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Published molecular studies have tended to focus on generating data for geographically localised communities of species of importance, which has limited the consideration of intraspecific variation in species of global distribution. This study used phylogenetic analysis to assess the species status of 27 forensically important calliphorid species based on 1167 base pairs of the COI gene of 119 specimens from 22 countries, and confirmed the utility of the COI gene in identifying most species. The species Lucilia cuprina, Chrysomya megacephala, Ch. saffranea, Ch. albifrontalis and Calliphora stygia were unable to be monophyletically resolved based on these data. Identification of phylogenetically young species will require a faster-evolving molecular marker, but most species could be unambiguously characterised by sampling relatively few conspecific individuals if they were from distant localities.

They were first developed in the 1870s and honed during the mid 20th Century. In spite of this long history and their central role in organizing research on plant-pollinator interactions, the pollination syndromes have rarely been subjected to test. The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers. METHODS: Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes, and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized. KEY RESULTS: Ordination of flowers in a multivariate 'phenotype space' defined by the syndromes showed that almost no plant species fall within the discrete syndrome clusters. Furthermore, in approximately two-thirds of plant species, the most common pollinator could not be successfully predicted by assuming that each plant species belongs to the syndrome closest to it in phenotype space. CONCLUSIONS: The pollination syndrome hypothesis as usually articulated does not successfully describe the diversity of floral phenotypes or predict the pollinators of most plant species. Caution is suggested when using pollination syndromes for organizing floral diversity, or for inferring agents of floral adaptation. A fresh look at how traits of flowers and pollinators relate to visitation and pollen transfer is recommended, in order to determine whether axes can be identified that describe floral functional diversity more successfully than the traditional syndromes.","tags":["pollination"],"website":"http:\/\/aob.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/103\/9\/1471","pages":"1471-1480","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-global-test-of-the-pollination-syndrome-hypothesis\/","volume":"103","categories":[152,119,35,32,48,201,212,43,29,44,210,352]},"ed7d5b00-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"pmid":"12511946"},"stats":{"readers":361,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":62},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":29},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":6}],"country":[{"name":"","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":29},{"name":"Portugal","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":35},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":14}]},"issue":"6918","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Nature","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"ed7d5b00-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Camille","surname":"Parmesan"},{"forename":"Gary","surname":"Yohe"}],"title":"A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems.","year":2003,"groups":[{"profile_id":2526461,"date_added":1303229489000,"group_id":1041431},{"profile_id":4345171,"date_added":1301881507000,"group_id":1008781},{"profile_id":3982641,"date_added":1301287340000,"group_id":990091},{"profile_id":3746731,"date_added":1300273245000,"group_id":939281},{"profile_id":39912,"date_added":1296477292000,"group_id":839661},{"profile_id":920981,"date_added":1292836210000,"group_id":747671},{"profile_id":2691511,"date_added":1291250094000,"group_id":737401},{"profile_id":2691511,"date_added":1291250094000,"group_id":737471},{"profile_id":969591,"date_added":1290083436000,"group_id":655081},{"profile_id":5873,"date_added":1286291340000,"group_id":531201},{"profile_id":27624,"date_added":1284405033000,"group_id":440691},{"profile_id":1745121,"date_added":1277652372000,"group_id":274421},{"profile_id":1059511,"date_added":1270265813000,"group_id":187951},{"profile_id":454641,"date_added":1265636579000,"group_id":112181},{"profile_id":102182,"date_added":1259934484000,"group_id":59871},{"profile_id":113082,"date_added":1257758613000,"group_id":42512},{"profile_id":16365,"date_added":1244732311000,"group_id":2091}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes.

Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term\/large-scale\/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species.

Thus, statistical image analyses that can be performed on fluorescence microscopy images of fixed or live cells have been routinely applied for biophysical and cell biological studies. These approaches measure the fraction of interacting particles by analyzing dual color fluorescence images for colocalized pixels. Colocalization algorithms have proven to be effective, although the dynamic range and accuracy of these measurements has never been well established. Spatial image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS), which cross-correlates spatial intensity fluctuations recorded in images from two detection channels simultaneously, has also recently been shown to be an effective measure of colocalization as well. Through simulations, imaging of fluorescent antibodies adsorbed on glass and cell measurements, we show that ICCS performs much better than standard colocalization algorithms at moderate to high densities of particles, which are often encountered in cellular systems. Furthermore, it was found that the density ratio between the two labeled species of interest plays a major role in the accuracy of the colocalization analysis. By applying a direct and systematic comparison between the standard, fluorescence microscopy colocalization algorithm and spatial ICCS, we show regimes where each approach is applicable, and more importantly, where they fail to yield accurate results.","tags":["colocalization"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17012312","pages":"4611-4622","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-guide-to-accurate-fluorescence-microscopy-colocalization-measurements\/","volume":"91","categories":[519,101,38,42,43,41,47,462,455,387,332,385,27,331,38]},"02723170-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"pmid":"16299475"},"stats":{"readers":367,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":82},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":5},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":32},{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"Estonia","value":0}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":41},{"name":"Post Doc","value":22},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":9}]},"issue":"12","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Nature Methods","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"02723170-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Nathan C","surname":"Shaner"},{"forename":"Paul A","surname":"Steinbach"},{"forename":"Roger Y","surname":"Tsien"}],"title":"A guide to choosing fluorescent proteins.","year":2005,"groups":[{"profile_id":4455271,"date_added":1303517717000,"group_id":1034681},{"profile_id":30075,"date_added":1303322197000,"group_id":1057641},{"profile_id":800401,"date_added":1301677736000,"group_id":1005021},{"profile_id":800401,"date_added":1301677660000,"group_id":776961},{"profile_id":68202,"date_added":1292346051000,"group_id":736931},{"profile_id":2536021,"date_added":1290544408000,"group_id":681721},{"profile_id":2621561,"date_added":1286525710000,"group_id":567131},{"profile_id":758921,"date_added":1284872123000,"group_id":557311},{"profile_id":7450,"date_added":1281960447000,"group_id":397081},{"profile_id":176452,"date_added":1274955397000,"group_id":238861},{"profile_id":329051,"date_added":1260036388000,"group_id":495481},{"profile_id":14432,"date_added":1242905247000,"group_id":1697},{"profile_id":353751,"date_added":0,"group_id":63411}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"The recent explosion in the diversity of available fluorescent proteins (FPs) promises a wide variety of new tools for biological imaging.

Overall, these new approaches have created unprecedented new possibilities to investigate the structure and function of cells.","website":"http:\/\/www.jcb.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1083\/jcb.201002018","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2918923","other":"201002018","pmid":"20643879","pmc_id":"2918923","doi":"10.1083\/jcb.201002018"},"stats":{"readers":86,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":76},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":12},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":22},{"name":"Spain","value":2},{"name":"United Kingdom","value":20}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":44},{"name":"Post Doc","value":24},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":9}]},"issue":"2","pages":"165-175","publication_outlet":"The Journal of Cell Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/guide-superresolution-fluorescence-microscopy-23\/","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","uuid":"a4ef3d60-ed90-11df-99a6-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Lothar","surname":"Schermelleh"},{"forename":"Rainer","surname":"Heintzmann"},{"forename":"Heinrich","surname":"Leonhardt"}],"title":"A guide to super-resolution fluorescence microscopy","volume":"190","year":2010,"categories":[101,279,38,42,282,43,382,41,193,379,44,378,51,85,462,48,80,52,387,25,27,385,30],"groups":[{"profile_id":569041,"date_added":1304079397000,"group_id":754611},{"profile_id":447561,"date_added":1298028637000,"group_id":835981}],"oa_journal":false},"dbe87870-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"pmid":"17210054"},"stats":{"readers":87,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":82},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":9},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"","value":1},{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":23}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":34},{"name":"Post Doc","value":22},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":15}]},"issue":"Pt 3","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Journal of Microscopy","publisher":"Citeseer","uuid":"dbe87870-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"S","surname":"Bolte"},{"forename":"F P","surname":"Cordeli\u00e8res"}],"title":"A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.","year":2006,"groups":[{"profile_id":3216751,"date_added":1299515398000,"group_id":931011},{"profile_id":575591,"date_added":1281491603000,"group_id":504551},{"profile_id":12458,"date_added":1277891155000,"group_id":58621}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"It is generally accepted that the functional compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells is reflected by the differential occurrence of proteins in their compartments. The location and physiological function of a protein are closely related; local information of a protein is thus crucial to understanding its role in biological processes. The visualization of proteins residing on intracellular structures by fluorescence microscopy has become a routine approach in cell biology and is increasingly used to assess their colocalization with well-characterized markers. However, image-analysis methods for colocalization studies are a field of contention and enigma. We have therefore undertaken to review the most currently used colocalization analysis methods, introducing the basic optical concepts important for image acquisition and subsequent analysis. We provide a summary of practical tips for image acquisition and treatment that should precede proper colocalization analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the application and feasibility of colocalization tools for various biological colocalization situations and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We have created a novel toolbox for subcellular colocalization analysis under ImageJ, named JACoP, that integrates current global statistic methods and a novel object-based approach.","tags":["colocalization"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17210054","pages":"213-232","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-guided-tour-into-subcellular-colocalization-analysis-in-light-microscopy\/","volume":"224","categories":[3,101,38,42,43,41,314,192,316,44,51,462,48,262,25,455,335,385,27,331,30,42]},"3ea1e870-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"issn":"00671924","doi":"10.1071\/BT02124"},"stats":{"readers":194,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":67},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":29},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":19},{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"Greece","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":41},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":15},{"name":"Post Doc","value":11}]},"issue":"4","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Australian Journal of Botany","publisher":"C S I R O PUBLISHING","uuid":"3ea1e870-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"J H C","surname":"Cornelissen"},{"forename":"S","surname":"Lavorel"},{"forename":"E","surname":"Garnier"},{"forename":"S","surname":"D\u00edaz"},{"forename":"N","surname":"Buchmann"},{"forename":"D E","surname":"Gurvich"},{"forename":"Peter B","surname":"Reich"},{"forename":"H Ter","surname":"Steege"},{"forename":"H D","surname":"Morgan"},{"forename":"M G A","surname":"Van Der Heijden"},{"forename":"J G","surname":"Pausas"},{"forename":"H","surname":"Poorter"}],"title":"A handbook of protocols for standardised and easy measurement of plant functional traits worldwide","year":2003,"groups":[{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1304428998000,"group_id":1086371},{"profile_id":4395921,"date_added":1302868573000,"group_id":1014561},{"profile_id":4082561,"date_added":1301247884000,"group_id":989111},{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1300465271000,"group_id":966611},{"profile_id":2006681,"date_added":1294991570000,"group_id":599211},{"profile_id":1505691,"date_added":1293125163000,"group_id":740621},{"profile_id":3228391,"date_added":1292470492000,"group_id":740911},{"profile_id":71152,"date_added":1292186884000,"group_id":533651},{"profile_id":1047761,"date_added":1269664246000,"group_id":185741},{"profile_id":71152,"date_added":1255542594000,"group_id":533691}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"There is growing recognition that classifying terrestrial plant species on the basis of their function into 'functional types') rather than their higher taxonomic identity, is a promising way forward for tackling important ecological questions at the scale of ecosystems, landscapes or biomes. These questions include those on vegetation responses to and vegetation effects on, environmental changes e. g. changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, land use or other disturbances). There is also growing consensus about a shortlist of plant traits that should underlie such functional plant classifications, because they have strong predictive power of important ecosystem responses to environmental change and\/or they themselves have strong impacts on ecosystem processes. The most favoured traits are those that are also relatively easy and inexpensive to measure for large numbers of plant species. Large international research efforts, promoted by the IGBP-GCTE Programme, are underway to screen predominant plant species in various ecosystems and biomes worldwide for such traits. This paper provides an international methodological protocol aimed at standardising this research effort, based on consensus among a broad group of scientists in this field. It features a practical handbook with step-by-step recipes, with relatively brief information about the ecological context, for 28 functional traits recognised as critical for tackling large-scale ecological questions.","tags":["bolivia","hawaii"],"website":"http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/?paper=BT02124","pages":"335","public_file_hash":"ee5eb6cf9da1a65132460c4d03c2151fd5f359b9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/what-determines-the-number-of-seed-produced-in-a-flowering-event-a-case-study-of-calyptrogyne-ghiesbreghtiana-arecaceae\/","volume":"51","categories":[34,32,101,201,200,203,43,41,45,119,462,49,48,21,23,430,52,29,210]},"4ee16cd0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Cell pattern in the ventral neural tube is organized by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted by floor plate cells.

Thermally driven dynamics on different timescales have been experimentally observed or simulated, and a direct link between micro- to milli-second domain motions and enzymatic function has been established. However, very little is understood about the connection of these functionally relevant, collective movements with local atomic fluctuations, which are much faster. Here we show that pico- to nano-second timescale atomic fluctuations in hinge regions of adenylate kinase facilitate the large-scale, slower lid motions that produce a catalytically competent state. The fast, local mobilities differ between a mesophilic and hyperthermophilic adenylate kinase, but are strikingly similar at temperatures at which enzymatic activity and free energy of folding are matched. The connection between different timescales and the corresponding amplitudes of motions in adenylate kinase and their linkage to catalytic function is likely to be a general characteristic of protein energy landscapes.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18026087","identifiers":{"pmid":"18026087"},"stats":{"readers":58,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":71},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":9},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":7}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":34},{"name":"Spain","value":2},{"name":"Ireland","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":38},{"name":"Post Doc","value":22},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":7}]},"issue":"7171","pages":"913-916","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-hierarchy-of-timescales-in-protein-dynamics-is-linked-to-enzyme-catalysis\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"f3cd4d70-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Katherine A","surname":"Henzler-Wildman"},{"forename":"Ming","surname":"Lei"},{"forename":"Vu","surname":"Thai"},{"forename":"S Jordan","surname":"Kerns"},{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Karplus"},{"forename":"Dorothee","surname":"Kern"}],"title":"A hierarchy of timescales in protein dynamics is linked to enzyme catalysis.","volume":"450","year":2007,"categories":[35,101,43,44,194,85,187,81,80,455,364,454,27,385,300,390,30,90,80],"groups":[{"profile_id":266702,"date_added":1277912015000,"group_id":333281},{"profile_id":497661,"date_added":1264072914000,"group_id":95141}],"oa_journal":false},"ed94e530-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"A comprehensive phylogenetic classification of the kingdom Fungi is proposed, with reference to recent molecular phylogenetic analyses, and with input from diverse members of the fungal taxonomic community.

The Chytridiomycota is retained in a restricted sense, with Blastocladiomycota and Neocallimastigomycota representing segregate phyla of flagellated Fungi. Taxa traditionally placed in Zygomycota are distributed among Glomeromycota and several subphyla incertae sedis, including Mucoromycotina, Entomophthoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina, and Zoopagomycotina. Microsporidia are included in the Fungi, but no further subdivision of the group is proposed.

Current imaging methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Confocal microscopy, Electron Microscopy (EM) or Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) yield three-dimensional (3D) data sets in need of appropriate computational methods for their analysis. The reconstruction, segmentation and registration are best approached from the 3D representation of the data set. Results: Here we present a platform-independent framework based on Java and Java 3D for accelerated rendering of biological images. Our framework is seamlessly integrated into ImageJ, a free image processing package with a vast collection of community-developed biological image analysis tools. Our framework enriches the ImageJ software libraries with methods that greatly reduce the complexity of developing image analysis tools in an interactive 3D visualization environment. In particular, we provide high-level access to volume rendering, volume editing, surface extraction, and image annotation. The ability to rely on a library that removes the low-level details enables concentrating software development efforts on the algorithm implementation parts. Conclusions: Our framework enables biomedical image software development to be built with 3D visualization capabilities with very little effort.

Three of the most influential reviews that summarized well some of the \"older\" literature include those by Nicolson (1967), Gerdemann (1968) and Mosse (1973). Instead, in this brief and incomplete work, we attempt to show the historical development of research on arbuscular mycorrhizas. We owe much to those who have written other historical accounts, including Rayner (1926-1927), Trappe and Berch (1985), Mosse (1985), Schenck (1985), Harley (1991) and Allen (1996), but the contents of this work naturally reflect our own ignorance, interests and biases. It was often difficult to distinguish between the historical and the contemporary, and we did not use any specific cutoff date in making this distinction. The degree to which we include \"contemporary\" literature was determined by our own assessment of its connectedness to older literature. In any case, we hope this will be of some interest to those of you who study the arbuscular mycorrhiza, and that it will serve the purpose of providing what we consider to be an important historical context for current researchers. We wish you good fortune in your research.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15088135","identifiers":{"pmid":"15088135"},"stats":{"readers":24,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":75},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":17},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":8}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":50},{"name":"Portugal","value":4},{"name":"Canada","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":38},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":13},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":8}]},"issue":"3","pages":"145-163","publication_outlet":"Mycorrhiza","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-history-of-research-on-arbuscular-mycorrhiza\/","publisher":"Springer","uuid":"b2ce3ea0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Roger T","surname":"Koide"},{"forename":"Barbara","surname":"Mosse"}],"title":"A history of research on arbuscular mycorrhiza.","volume":"14","year":2004,"categories":[34,119,35,48,21,201,25,43,41,29,210,45,201,219,41,45],"groups":[{"profile_id":1223411,"date_added":1271524145000,"group_id":210491}],"oa_journal":false},"0c345120-6d0a-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Lake and peat corings on three Azores islands in the central North Atlantic, resulted in the discovery of a 6000 year long lacustrine sequence in a small crater lake, Lake Caveiro, on the island of Pico. This island is dominated by Pico mountain (2351 m), Portugals highest mountain, and the lake site is situated at 903m asl. Two sediment profiles, one central and one littoral, were sampled. Due to large facial shifts and disconformities in the littoral cores the analyses were concentrated on the central core; only the earliest 1000 years of the littoral core were studied to complement the central profile. We used sedimentology, geochemistry, diatom analyses, magnetic properties, and multivariate statistics, together with 14C and 210Pb dating techniques, to analyse the environmental history of the lake. Volcanic activity seems to have had a dominating impact on sediment changes and partly also on the diatom assemblages; a large number of tephras are found and seem to be connected with large (diatom) inferred pH variations. However, by a combination of methods, including multivariate techniques, we infer that precipitation changes can be detected through the volcanic noise. In the youngest part of the record (AD 16002000), with its decadal resolution, these humidity variations seem partly related to shifts in dominating NAO mode. The more long-term precipitation changes further back in time (3505100 cal yr BP) roughly correspond to the well-known North Atlantic drift-ice variations as well as other North Atlantic records; low precipitation during drift-ice periods. We think these alterations were driven by changes in the thermohaline circulation as large-scale equivalences to the Great Salt Anomaly; low sea surface temperatures and changes in circulation patterns of the central North Atlantic decreased the regional precipitation. Cooler\/drier periods occurred 400800, 13001800, 26003000, 33003400 and possibly also 44004600 cal yr BP, while 300400, 9001000, 20002400, 31003200, 38004000 and 47005000 cal yrBP seem to have been more humid phases on the Azores.","identifiers":{"issn":"02773791","doi":"10.1016\/j.quascirev.2005.08.008"},"website":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0277379105002647","stats":{"readers":10,"discipline":[{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":50},{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":30},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":20}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":20},{"name":"Argentina","value":20},{"name":"Germany","value":30}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":50},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":20},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":10}]},"issue":"1-2","pages":"9-32","publication_outlet":"Quaternary Science Reviews","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-holocene-lacustrine-record-in-the-central-north-atlantic-proxies-for-volcanic-activity-shortterm-nao-mode-variability-and-longterm-precipitation-changes\/","uuid":"0c345120-6d0a-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Svante","surname":"Bj\u00f6rck"},{"forename":"Tammy","surname":"Rittenour"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Ros\u00e9n"},{"forename":"Zilda","surname":"Fran\u00e7a"},{"forename":"Per","surname":"M\u00f6ller"},{"forename":"Ian","surname":"Snowball"},{"forename":"Stefan","surname":"Wasteg\u00e5rd"},{"forename":"Ole","surname":"Bennike"},{"forename":"Bernd","surname":"Kromer"}],"title":"A Holocene lacustrine record in the central North Atlantic: proxies for volcanic activity, short-term NAO mode variability, and long-term precipitation changes","volume":"25","year":2006,"categories":[119,114,22,52,112,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":236902,"date_added":1259148604000,"group_id":52261}],"oa_journal":false},"4ec5ce80-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Distinct classes of neurons are generated at defined positions in the ventral neural tube in response to a gradient of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) activity.

We explored patterns of limnological variables (physical, chemical and biological) with relation to landscape position (expressed as lake order) in 86 study lakes located on shield bedrock in south-central Ontario, Canada. 2. Using ANOVA ANOVAs with lake order as the categorical variable, landscape position explained significant amounts of variation in major ion chemistry, physical and catchment characteristics, hypolimnetic oxygen, and community composition in algal (diatom, chrysophyte) and invertebrate (chironomid) assemblages preserved in surficial sediments. Several nutrient variables (TP, total phosphorus and TN, total nitrogen) and dissolved organic carbon did not have significant relationships with lake order. 3. The strongest relationships with lake order (as a fraction of variation explained in ANOVA ANOVAs) included silica concentrations (r(2) = 0.40) and SO4 (r(2) = 0.29) concentrations, surface area (r(2) = 0.50) and hypolimnetic oxygen (r(2) = 0.29). 4. Bedrock geology (carbonate metasedimentary versus non-carbonate bedrock) had strong influences on spatial gradients of pH and major ion chemistry. It was difficult to separate geological influences from spatial influences on limnological variables in this study, as drainage patterns in the region are highly influenced by surface features of underlying geological formations because of the very thin glacial till or exposed bedrock that exists in most catchments. 5. Patterns of limnological variables indicated that low-order, headwater lakes had the lowest concentrations of major ions, and, from algal inferences of pH change, had been most susceptible to acidic deposition. High-order, downstream lakes were larger and deeper, and had higher concentrations of hypolimnetic oxygen, indicating that optimal lake trout habitat was primarily located in high-order lakes. 6. Variance partitioning analyses indicated that lake order as a metric of landscape position explained comparable portions of community variation in algal and invertebrate assemblages compared with geographic position (latitude, longitude) and Cartesian coordinate position (e.g. x, y, x(2), y(2), etc.) metrics. Lake order explained more community variation in chironomid assemblages compared with other landscape metrics, possibly because of the strong relationships between lake order and lake morphometry variables.","keywords":["chironomids","chrysophytes","diatoms","lake order","landscape","paleoecology"],"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1046\/j.1365-2427.2003.01105.x","identifiers":{"issn":"00465070","doi":"10.1046\/j.1365-2427.2003.01105.x"},"stats":{"readers":20,"discipline":[{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":45},{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":45},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":10}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":25},{"name":"Canada","value":20},{"name":"Ecuador","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":50},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":10}]},"issue":"9","pages":"1676-1697","publication_outlet":"Freshwater Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-landscape-approach-to-examining-spatial-patterns-of-limnological-variables-and-longterm-environmental-change-in-a-southern-canadian-lake-district\/","publisher":"Blackwell Science Ltd","uuid":"87196eb0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Roberto","surname":"Quinlan"},{"forename":"Andrew M","surname":"Paterson"},{"forename":"Roland I","surname":"Hall"},{"forename":"Peter J","surname":"Dillon"},{"forename":"Anna N","surname":"Wilkinson"},{"forename":"Brian F","surname":"Cumming"},{"forename":"Marianne S V","surname":"Douglas"},{"forename":"John P","surname":"Smol"}],"title":"A landscape approach to examining spatial patterns of limnological variables and long-term environmental change in a southern Canadian lake district","volume":"48","year":2003,"categories":[119,34,32,207,201,39,112,43,209,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":2824961,"date_added":1289333930000,"group_id":640851},{"profile_id":2824961,"date_added":1289239682000,"group_id":632841},{"profile_id":173312,"date_added":1256764102000,"group_id":29402},{"profile_id":19816,"date_added":1246648296000,"group_id":2533}],"oa_journal":false},"d2c4b010-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were infected concomitantly with Argulus coregoni and Flavobacterium columnare and their survival was compared with that of fish infected with either the parasite or the bacterium alone.

This updated survey of the recent literature shows that the sequential fractionation proposed by Hedley et al. can also be used to separate forms of organically bound soil phosphorus from the geochemically bound fractions. We consider that biological P includes all the extracted organic fractions (Bicarb Po, NaOH Po, Sonic Po) and geochemical P includes the remaining fractions (Resin Pi, Bicarb Pi, NaOH Pi, Sonic Pi, HC1 Pi) and the Po and Pi in the Residual fraction. Data from the Hedley fractionation suggest that the contribution of geochemical versus biological processes to soil phosphorus availability varies with pedogenesis. The pool of primary phosphate declines and the NaOH and sonicated-NaOH phosphorus fractions increase as phosphorus becomes geochemically fixed to the iron and aluminum oxides in more highly weathered soils. The sum of organic-P fractions - biological P - is an increasing proportion of total available P as a function of soil development. Therefore, the Hedley fractionation provides a valuable index of the relative importance of biological processes to soil phosphorus content across a soil weathering gradient.","identifiers":{"issn":"00167061","doi":"10.1016\/0016-7061(94)00023-4"},"website":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/0016706194000234","stats":{"readers":16,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":44},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":31},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":25}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":19},{"name":"Czech Republic","value":6},{"name":"Canada","value":13}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":38},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":19},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":13}]},"issue":"3-4","pages":"197-214","publication_outlet":"Geoderma","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-literature-review-and-evaluation-of-the-hedley-fractionation-applications-to-the-biogeochemical-cycle-of-soil-phosphorus-in-natural-ecosystems\/","uuid":"324d2b70-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"A","surname":"Cross"}],"title":"A literature review and evaluation of the Hedley fractionation: Applications to the biogeochemical cycle of soil phosphorus in natural ecosystems","volume":"64","year":1995,"categories":[119,49,48,201,112,43,41,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1304428999000,"group_id":1086371},{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1300465273000,"group_id":966611}],"oa_journal":false},"b9bf3df0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Aim To integrate ecological fitting, the oscillation hypothesis and the taxon pulse hypothesis into a coherent null model for the evolution of complex host-parasite associations. Location Global. Methods This paper reviews and synthesizes literature that focuses on phylogenetic analyses and reciprocal mapping of a model system of hosts and their parasites to determine patterns of host-parasite associations and geographical distributions through time. Results Host-switching and geographical dispersal of parasites are common phenomena, occurring on many temporal and spatial scales. Diversification involving both co-evolution and colonization explains complex host-parasite associations. Across the expanse of Earth history, the major radiations in host-parasite assemblages have been preceded by ecological disruption, ecological breakdown and host-switching in a context that can be defined by the concept of ecological fitting. This cyclical process sets the stage for co-diversification during periods of relative stability, punctuated by host-switching during episodes of regional to global environmental disruption and climatological change. Main conclusions Most observed host-parasite associations can be explained by an historical interaction between ecological fitting, oscillation (episodes of increasing host range alternating with isolation on particular hosts) and taxon pulses (cyclical episodes of expansion and isolation in geographical range). Major episodes of environmental change appear to be the main drivers for both the persistence and diversification of host-parasite systems, creating opportunities for host-switching during periods of geographical expansion and allowing for co-evolution and co-speciation during periods of geographical isolation.","keywords":["biogeography","ecological fitting","episodic host switching","geographical colonization","historical","hosts","oscillation hypothesis","parasite diversification","parasites","taxon pulse hypothesis"],"website":"http:\/\/blackwell-synergy.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2008.01951.x","identifiers":{"issn":"03050270","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2008.01951.x"},"stats":{"readers":31,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":94},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":6}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":29},{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"Mexico","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":35},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":23},{"name":"Post Doc","value":19}]},"pages":"1533-1550","issue":"9","publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-macroevolutionary-mosaic-episodic-hostswitching-geographical-colonization-and-diversification-in-complex-hostparasite-systems\/","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","uuid":"b9bf3df0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Eric P","surname":"Hoberg"},{"forename":"Daniel R","surname":"Brooks"}],"title":"A macroevolutionary mosaic: episodic host-switching, geographical colonization and diversification in complex host-parasite systems","chapter":"5","volume":"35","year":2008,"categories":[51,35,32,201,36,23,52,43,46,47],"groups":[{"profile_id":12580,"date_added":1242153666000,"group_id":5698},{"profile_id":12451,"date_added":1242153666000,"group_id":1513},{"profile_id":3377,"date_added":1239105755000,"group_id":1297},{"profile_id":5873,"date_added":1236010868000,"group_id":538191}],"oa_journal":false},"31e6ef90-6d00-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"We report the development of magneto-optic technology for the rapid quantitative diagnosis of malaria that may also be realizable in a noninvasive format. Hemozoin, the waste product of malarial parasitic action on hemoglobin, is produced in a form that under the action of an applied magnetic field gives rise to an induced optical dichroism characteristic of the hemozoin concentration. Here we show that precise measurement of this induced dichroism may be used to determine the level of malarial infection because this correlates, albeit in a complex manner throughout the infection cycle, with the concentration of hemozoin in the blood and tissues of infected patients. Under conservative assumptions for the production of hemozoin as a function of parasitemia, initial results indicate that the technique can match or exceed other current diagnostic techniques. The validity of the approach is confirmed by a small preliminary clinical trial on 13 patients, and measurements on live parasitized cells obtained from in vitro culture verify the possibility of

Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites.

Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits.

Effects of the symbiosis on plants span the continuum from mutualism to parasitism. We sought to understand this variation in symbiotic function using meta-analysis with information theory-based model selection to assess the relative importance of factors in five categories: (1) identity of the host plant and its functional characteristics, (2) identity and type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal), (3) soil fertility, (4) biotic complexity of the soil and (5) experimental location (laboratory vs. field). Across most subsets of the data, host plant functional group and N-fertilization were surprisingly much more important in predicting plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation ('plant response') than other factors. Non-N-fixing forbs and woody plants and C(4) grasses responded more positively to mycorrhizal inoculation than plants with N-fixing bacterial symbionts and C(3) grasses. In laboratory studies of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, plant response was more positive when the soil community was more complex. Univariate analyses supported the hypothesis that plant response is most positive when plants are P-limited rather than N-limited. These results emphasize that mycorrhizal function depends on both abiotic and biotic context, and have implications for plant community theory and restoration ecology.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20100237","identifiers":{"pmid":"20100237"},"stats":{"readers":33,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":73},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":18},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":9}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":45},{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"Korea (South)","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":39},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":15},{"name":"Professor","value":12}]},"issue":"3","pages":"394-407","publication_outlet":"Ecology Letters","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metaanalysis-contextdependency-plant-response-inoculation-mycorrhizal-fungi\/","publisher":"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","uuid":"ef1dc390-6d0a-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"Jason D","surname":"Hoeksema"},{"forename":"V Bala","surname":"Chaudhary"},{"forename":"Catherine A","surname":"Gehring"},{"forename":"Nancy Collins","surname":"Johnson"},{"forename":"Justine","surname":"Karst"},{"forename":"Roger T","surname":"Koide"},{"forename":"Anne","surname":"Pringle"},{"forename":"Catherine","surname":"Zabinski"},{"forename":"James D","surname":"Bever"},{"forename":"John C","surname":"Moore"},{"forename":"Gail W T","surname":"Wilson"},{"forename":"John N","surname":"Klironomos"},{"forename":"James","surname":"Umbanhowar"}],"title":"A meta-analysis of context-dependency in plant response to inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi.","volume":"13","year":2010,"categories":[34,35,201,36,110,43,41,45,119,49,48,21,52,29,210,201,352,41],"oa_journal":false},"01c65250-6d06-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["co2","fungi"],"abstract":"Numerous field studies have measured mycorrhizal dynamics under additions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or atmospheric CO2 to test the hypothesis that plants should invest in mycorrhizal fungi when soil nutrients are limiting.

While conventional metapopulation theory involves species with frequent population turnover, limited migration and random extinction, it is likely that metapopulation dynamics, broadly defined as the product of local population dynamics and dispersal, is a feature of all species. 2 Theoretical metapopulation models of single species make three critical insights. First, metapopulations will consist of a shifting mosaic of local populations linked through migration with only a fraction of the available habitat patches occupied at one time. Secondly, there is a threshold number of habitats available, below which the species cannot persist because extinction exceeds colonization. Thirdly, the antagonism between selective forces acting during recolonization and population growth can influence the evolution of phenotypic traits. Unfortunately, little empirical data is available to evaluate these ideas for plants or to address the broader issue of whether processes at a regional scale add anything to our understanding of population dynamics. 3 Plants may seem particularly appropriate for metapopulation analyses as a result of their immobility, strong spatial structure and restricted dispersal. However, a review of the literature revealed a paucity of studies that explicitly adopted a metapopulation approach, particularly in terms of testing theoretical models. We argue that this is because of the difficulty of measuring parameters such as extinction, colonization and migration that are central to most metapopulation models. 4 Plants possess a number of special features that present both challenges and opportunities for the development of new insights into the biology of metapopulations. Three particular characteristics, seed dormancy, restricted dispersal and local adaptation, need to be incorporated into existing theoretical models so they more accurately reflect the dynamics of plant metapopulations. Finally, more effort is needed to incorporate the explicit spatial structure of individuals within metapopulations and to investigate the effect that dispersion has on their growth and reproduction.","website":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/2261207","identifiers":{"issn":"00220477","doi":"10.2307\/2261207"},"stats":{"readers":43,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":79},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":19},{"id":9,"name":"Education","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":26},{"name":"Ecuador","value":2},{"name":"Spain","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":26},{"name":"Post Doc","value":14},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":12}]},"issue":"3","pages":"461-469","publication_outlet":"Journal of Ecology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-metapopulation-perspective-in-plant-population-biology\/","publisher":"British Ecological Society","uuid":"f38f64a0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Brian C","surname":"Husband"},{"forename":"Spencer C H","surname":"Barrett"}],"title":"A metapopulation perspective in plant population biology","volume":"84","year":1996,"categories":[152,35,32,48,201,43,29,209,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":2867481,"date_added":1291726104000,"group_id":688401},{"profile_id":2810981,"date_added":1288723163000,"group_id":627831},{"profile_id":589491,"date_added":1283971192000,"group_id":555051},{"profile_id":2233301,"date_added":1282626523000,"group_id":408041},{"profile_id":2083361,"date_added":1282626523000,"group_id":544821},{"profile_id":18973,"date_added":1248193081000,"group_id":2424}],"oa_journal":false},"b4d6bc00-6d05-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"The ability to quantify the fluorescence signals from multiply labeled biological samples is highly desirable in the life sciences but often difficult, because of spectral overlap between fluorescent species and the presence of autofluorescence.

In the transmissible state, Leishmania spp., Coxiella burnetii, and Legionella pneumophila block phagosome maturation; after a pregnant pause, replicative forms emerge and thrive in lysosomes.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11886587","identifiers":{"pmid":"11886587"},"stats":{"readers":5,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":60},{"name":"Canada","value":20},{"name":"India","value":20}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":40},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":40},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":20}]},"issue":"3","pages":"170-177","publication_outlet":"Traffic Copenhagen Denmark","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microbial-strategy-multiply-macrophages-pregnant-pause\/","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","uuid":"e472bef0-6d0a-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"Michele S","surname":"Swanson"},{"forename":"Esteban","surname":"Fernandez-Moreira"}],"title":"A microbial strategy to multiply in macrophages: the pregnant pause.","volume":"3","year":2002,"categories":[43,47,352,41],"oa_journal":false},"bfbe1fa0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"A combined mineral magnetic and scaled chrysophyte study of lake sediments from Lake Lacawac and Lake Giles in northeastern Pennsylvania was conducted to determine the effects of land-use and sediment source changes on the variation of pH, conductivity, and alkalinity inferred from biotic changes. Ten 30-40 cm long gravity cores were collected from Lake Lacawac and three from Lake Giles. Isothermal remanent magnetizations (IRMs) were given to the lake sediments in a 1.3 T magnetic field to measure magnetic mineral concentration variations. IRM acquisition experiments were conducted to identify magnetic mineralogy. The bedrock, soils and a peat bog on the shores of Lake Lacawac were also sampled for magnetic analysis to determine possible lake sediment sources. The top 10 cm of sediment collected from Lakes Lacawac and Giles was two to four times more magnetic than deeper sediment. Pb-210 dating suggests that this intensity increase commenced circa 1900. SEM images of magnetic extracts from the highly magnetic sediments indicates the presence of magnetic fly ash microspheres from fossil fuel burning electric power generation plants. The similarity in magnetic coercivity in the top 8 cm lake sediments and in the peat bog supports an atmospheric source for some of the magnetic minerals in the youngest lake sediments. The highly magnetic sediments also contain an antiferromagnetic mineral in two cores closest to Lake Lacawac's southeastern shore. This magnetic mineral is only present deep in the soil profile and would suggest erosion and significant land-use changes in the Lacawac watershed as another cause for the high magnetic intensities (concentrations) in the top 10 cm of the lake sediments. The most significant changes in the scaled chrysophyte flora occurred immediately above the 10 cm level and were used to infer a doubling of the specific conductivity between circa 1910 and 1929. These variations also support land-use changes in the Lacawac catchment at this time. A similar shift in the scaled chrysophte flora was not observed in the top of Lake Giles, however, distinct changes were found in the deeper sections of the core coupled with a smaller peak in magnetic concentration. Fourier analysis of the Pb-210-dated lake sediment magnetics indicates the presence of a 50 year period, low amplitude variation in the Lake Lacawac, Lake Giles, and Lake Waynewood (Lott et al., 1994) magnetic concentration records. After removal of the land-use\/fly ash magnetic concentration peak by Gaussian filtering, the 50 year variation correlates strongly from lake to lake even though the lakes are in different watersheds separated by up to 30 km. When this magnetic variation is compared with Gaussian-filtered rainfall variations observed in New York City and Philadelphia over the past 120-250 years there is a strong correlation suggesting that magnetic concentration variations can record regional rainfall variations with an approximately 50 year period. This result indicates that magnetics could be used to document regional variations in climatic change.","keywords":["atmospheric fly ash deposition","land use changes","mineral magnetism","paleorainfall variation","pocono mountains","scaled chrysophytes"],"website":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/M2531574K24037GK.pdf","identifiers":{"issn":"09212728"},"stats":{"readers":7,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":57},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":29},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":14}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":14},{"name":"Argentina","value":29},{"name":"Brazil","value":14}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":29},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":29},{"name":"Professor","value":29}]},"issue":"2","pages":"173-189","publication_outlet":"Journal of Paleolimnology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-mineral-magnetic-and-scaledchrysophyte-paleolimnological-study-of-two-northeastern-pennsylvania-lakes-records-of-fly-ash-deposition-landuse-change-and-paleorainfall-variation\/","publisher":"Springer","uuid":"bfbe1fa0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"K P","surname":"Kodama"},{"forename":"J C","surname":"Lyons"},{"forename":"Peter A","surname":"Siver"},{"forename":"Anne-Marie","surname":"Lott"}],"title":"A mineral magnetic and scaled-chrysophyte paleolimnological study of two northeastern Pennsylvania lakes : records of fly ash deposition , land-use change , and paleorainfall variation","volume":"17","year":1997,"categories":[119,22,43,209,210],"oa_journal":false},"2d35a710-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Complex quantitative traits of plants as measured on collections of genotypes across multiple environments are the outcome of processes that depend in intricate ways on genotype and environment simultaneously. For a better understanding of the genetic architecture of such traits as observed across environments, genotype-by-environment interaction should be modeled with statistical models that use explicit information on genotypes and environments. The modeling approach we propose explains genotype-by-environment interaction by differential quantitative trait locus (QTL) expression in relation to environmental variables. We analyzed grain yield and grain moisture for an experimental data set composed of 976 F(5) maize testcross progenies evaluated across 12 environments in the U.S. corn belt during 1994 and 1995. The strategy we used was based on mixed models and started with a phenotypic analysis of multi-environment data, modeling genotype-by-environment interactions and associated genetic correlations between environments, while taking into account intraenvironmental error structures. The phenotypic mixed models were then extended to QTL models via the incorporation of marker information as genotypic covariables. A majority of the detected QTL showed significant QTL-by-environment interactions (QEI). The QEI were further analyzed by including environmental covariates into the mixed model. Most QEI could be understood as differential QTL expression conditional on longitude or year, both consequences of temperature differences during critical stages of the growth.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17947443","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2147942","other":"gen17731801","pmid":"17947443","pmc_id":"2147942","doi":"10.1534\/genetics.107.071068"},"stats":{"readers":26,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":96},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":12},{"name":"France","value":4},{"name":"Brazil","value":27}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":31},{"name":"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)","value":31},{"name":"Post Doc","value":12}]},"issue":"3","pages":"1801-1813","publication_outlet":"Genetics","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-mixedmodel-quantitative-trait-loci-qtl-analysis-for-multipleenvironment-trial-data-using-environmental-covariables-for-qtlbyenvironment-interactions-with-an-example-in-maize\/","publisher":"Genetics Society of America","uuid":"2d35a710-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Martin P","surname":"Boer"},{"forename":"Deanne","surname":"Wright"},{"forename":"Lizhi","surname":"Feng"},{"forename":"Dean W","surname":"Podlich"},{"forename":"Lang","surname":"Luo"},{"forename":"Mark","surname":"Cooper"},{"forename":"Fred A","surname":"Van Eeuwijk"}],"title":"A Mixed-Model Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) Analysis for Multiple-Environment Trial Data Using Environmental Covariables for QTL-by-Environment Interactions, With an Example in Maize","volume":"177","year":2007,"categories":[35,21,455,43,210,35],"groups":[{"profile_id":9348,"date_added":1305310523000,"group_id":1115381},{"profile_id":10557,"date_added":1305303292000,"group_id":1114701},{"profile_id":10557,"date_added":1250628384000,"group_id":1084},{"profile_id":9348,"date_added":1243024351000,"group_id":489361},{"profile_id":10397,"date_added":1240160739000,"group_id":1151}],"oa_journal":false},"d177aac0-6d0c-11df-936c-0026b95e484c":{"keywords":["accelerated life model","odonata","onset emergence","phenology","temperature dependence"],"identifiers":{"issn":"00465070","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2427.2008.02012.x"},"website":"http:\/\/blackwell-synergy.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1365-2427.2008.02012.x","stats":{"readers":8,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":88},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":13}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":13},{"name":"Brazil","value":38},{"name":"Chile","value":13}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":25},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":25},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":13}]},"issue":"9","pages":"1868-1880","publication_outlet":"Freshwater Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/model-predicting-emergence-dragonflies-changing-climate\/","uuid":"d177aac0-6d0c-11df-936c-0026b95e484c","authors":[{"forename":"Otto","surname":"Richter"},{"forename":"Frank","surname":"Suhling"},{"forename":"Ole","surname":"M\u00fcller"},{"forename":"Dietrich","surname":"Kern"}],"title":"A model for predicting the emergence of dragonflies in a changing climate","volume":"53","year":2008,"categories":[39,36,43,40,210],"oa_journal":false},"b88e0cc0-6d07-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"Pastoral livestock farms are complex and dynamic systems, and are subject to many forms of external disturbance.

This paper discusses the model design in detail and an example is then given in which different strategies of hay use during the winter are compared. The results of the simulations were reasonable, indicating the advantages of using hay in reducing the variability of system productivity, but the different patterns of hay use did not show any impact on the long run performance.

Differential equation models have shown how quite simple communication mechanisms can produce complex and functional group-level foraging patterns. In this paper we review previous differential equation models for pheromone trails, honey bee dances and other methods of communication used during foraging. We develop a general framework for modelling social insect foraging systems that incorporates each of the previous models. This framework identifies the different behaviours that insects undertake while foraging, along with generalised rate functions that determine how the insects switch between behaviours. We describe how to tailor our framework to specific insect societies, by incorporating the details of specific behavioural mechanisms into appropriate expressions for rates of discovery of, recruitment to, and retirement from food sources. Our framework thus provides an experimental tool for improved understanding of the foraging behaviour of particular species, as well as a system for meaningful comparisons of foraging behaviour across species. We end this article by linking our framework to inclusive fitness theory. We demonstrate how understanding of the proximate mechanisms involved in social insect foraging ultimately furthers understanding, not only of how insect societies function, but also of how these mechanisms are used to optimise colony fitness and survival.","website":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/HHV6BCLQG1MYT8ML.pdf","identifiers":{"issn":"03405443","doi":"10.1007\/s00265-002-0549-0"},"stats":{"readers":30,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":83},{"id":10,"name":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","value":7},{"id":8,"name":"Economics","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":13},{"name":"","value":3},{"name":"Israel","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":37},{"name":"Post Doc","value":23},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":10}]},"issue":"3","pages":"131-144","publication_outlet":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-modelling-framework-for-understanding-social-insect-foraging\/","publisher":"Springer","uuid":"8705e6b0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"T","surname":"Sumpter"},{"forename":"C","surname":"Pratt"}],"title":"A modelling framework for understanding social insect foraging","volume":"53","year":2003,"categories":[32,201,140,173,23,52,43,27,176,90],"groups":[{"profile_id":4585591,"date_added":1305470480000,"group_id":1118141},{"profile_id":2059371,"date_added":1279758344000,"group_id":547701},{"profile_id":1247101,"date_added":1274891745000,"group_id":227181},{"profile_id":26469,"date_added":1257793934000,"group_id":545661}],"oa_journal":false},"5003a5b0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"While significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular events underlying the early specification of the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, little information is available regarding the cellular or molecular basis for left-right (LR) differences in animal morphogenesis.

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.","tags":["anova","distance measure","linear model","multifactorial","multivariate dissimilarity","partitioning","permutation tests","statistics"],"keywords":["anova","distance measure","experimental design","linear model","multifactorial","multivariate dissimilarity","partitioning","permutation tests","statistics"],"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1046\/j.1442-9993.2001.01070.x","pages":"32-46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparisons-of-abundance-of-coralreef-fish-catch-and-effort-surveys-vs-visual-census\/","volume":"26","categories":[201,203,193,21,23,455,26,29,390,209,210,211,32,101,98,39,446,36,37,43,40,41,46,225,119,48,52,123,300,121,120]},"86bc0c70-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Genome-wide association studies are set to become the method of choice for uncovering the genetic basis of human diseases. A central challenge in this area is the development of powerful multipoint methods that can detect causal variants that have not been directly genotyped. We propose a coherent analysis framework that treats the problem as one involving missing or uncertain genotypes. Central to our approach is a model-based imputation method for inferring genotypes at observed or unobserved SNPs, leading to improved power over existing methods for multipoint association mapping. Using real genome-wide association study data, we show that our approach (i) is accurate and well calibrated, (ii) provides detailed views of associated regions that facilitate follow-up studies and (iii) can be used to validate and correct data at genotyped markers. A notable future use of our method will be to boost power by combining data from genome-wide scans that use different SNP sets.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17572673","identifiers":{"pmid":"17572673"},"stats":{"readers":111,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":65},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":17},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":7}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":41},{"name":"","value":2},{"name":"Taiwan","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":36},{"name":"Post Doc","value":17},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":11}]},"issue":"7","pages":"906-913","publication_outlet":"Nature Genetics","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-new-multipoint-method-for-genomewide-association-studies-by-imputation-of-genotypes\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"86bc0c70-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Jonathan","surname":"Marchini"},{"forename":"Bryan","surname":"Howie"},{"forename":"Simon","surname":"Myers"},{"forename":"Gil","surname":"McVean"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Donnelly"}],"title":"A new multipoint method for genome-wide association studies by imputation of genotypes.","volume":"39","year":2007,"categories":[342,35,411,101,43,434,316,405,326,462,16,353,320,455,25,332,300,331,303],"groups":[{"profile_id":10149,"date_added":1304623574000,"group_id":1090131},{"profile_id":2792481,"date_added":1294110443000,"group_id":621721},{"profile_id":1891241,"date_added":1287355292000,"group_id":322961}],"oa_journal":false},"d49677f0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"We tested pollen viability of eight species using four vital dyes, a new peroxidase test together with three other established methods (MTT, Bakers and X-Gal), to determine their potential to differentiate fresh pollen from pollen heated for 2 h and 24 h at 80C (killed pollen) and compared the results with in vitro germination.

However, it is only a heuristic approximation to maximum-likelihood estimated canonical Gaussian ordination (CGO), which is the \"ideal\" method. When proposed in the mid-1980s, CCA held two advantages over CGO: it was computationally cheaper, and its algorithm was, not complex. However, an exponential increase in computing speed over the last two decades has meant that computation cost is no longer such a compelling advantage. The computational complexity of CGO has always been its major difficulty, even though it is statistically more sound and Simpler to understand than CCA. For these reasons, no general computational framework or software has appeared until now. This article proposes a new class of statistical regression models called quadratic reduced-rank vector generalized linear models (QRR-VGLMs) for maximum-likelihood estimated CGO. This is achieved by extending a recently developed class of statistical models called RR-VGLMs. The extension is named QRR-VGLMs because of the addition of a quadratic form to each linear predictor, with the consequence that bell-shaped responses can be modeled as functions of latent environmental variables or gradients. QRR-VGLMs have several major positive features; for example, their framework is unifying and broad, so that canonical Gaussian ordination can potentially be performed on a wide range of data types. The two most important special cases of CGO in ecology, multispecies presence\/absence and Poisson abundance data, are considered in this article. The methodology is illustrated with a real data set using a software implementation written by the author in the S statistical language. The code, called the VGAM package in R, is object-oriented and free, and it allows QRR-VGLMs to be fitted to moderate-sized data sets conforming reasonably closely to the Gaussian model.","keywords":["analysis","canonical correspondence analysis","canonical gaussian ordination","dination","direct gradient","iteratively reweighted least squares","latent variables","linear models","logistic","maximum likelihood estimation","poisson","quadratic reduced rank vector generalized","reduced rank","regression","tolerance","unimodal response curve","vector generalized linear models"],"website":"http:\/\/www.esajournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1890\/03-0078","identifiers":{"issn":"00129615","doi":"10.1890\/03-0078"},"stats":{"readers":19,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":58},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":37},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"Panama","value":5},{"name":"France","value":5},{"name":"United States","value":21}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":21},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":21},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":21}]},"issue":"4","pages":"685-701","publication_outlet":"Ecological Monographs","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-technique-maximumlikelihood-canonical-gaussian-ordination\/","publisher":"Eco Soc America","uuid":"0d8ac3f0-6d0b-11df-936c-0026b95e484c","authors":[{"forename":"T W","surname":"Yee"}],"title":"a New Technique for Maximum-Likelihood Canonical Gaussian Ordination","volume":"74","year":2004,"categories":[48,201,43,434,26,210],"oa_journal":false},"75cfca20-611e-11e0-8f54-0024e8453de6":{"identifiers":{"issn":"00124966","doi":"10.1134\/S0012496609040061"},"website":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1134\/S0012496609040061","stats":{"readers":2,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"Argentina","value":100}],"status":[{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":50},{"name":"Professor","value":50}]},"issue":"1","pages":"325-328","publication_outlet":"Text","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biology-new-technique-reconstructing-cationanion-balance\/","uuid":"75cfca20-611e-11e0-8f54-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"I","surname":"Moiseenko"},{"forename":"L V","surname":"Razumovskiy"}],"title":"A New Technique for Reconstructing the Cation-Anion Balance in Lakes by Diatom Analysis","volume":"427","year":2009,"categories":[22],"oa_journal":false},"e17edee0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Ecologists now recognize that controversy over the relative importance of niches and neutrality cannot be resolved by analyzing species abundance patterns.

However, phylogenetic relationships within this group are poorly resolved. A robust evolutionary tree of Chiroptera is essential for evaluating the phylogeny of echolocation within Chiroptera, as well as for understanding their biogeographical history. We generated 4 kb of sequence data from portions of four novel nuclear intron markers for multiple representatives of 17 of the 18 recognized extant bat families, as well as the putative bat family Miniopteridae. Three echolocation-call characters were examined by mapping them onto the combined topology: (1) high-duty cycle versus low-duty cycle, (2) high-intensity versus low-intensity call emission, and (3) oral versus nasal emission. Echolocation seems to be highly convergent, and the mapping of echolocation-call design onto our phylogeny does not appear to resolve the question of whether echolocation had a single or two origins. Fossil taxa may also provide insight into the evolution of bats; we therefore evaluate 195 morphological characters in light of our nuclear DNA phylogeny. All but 24 of the morphological characters were found to be homoplasious when mapped onto the supermatrix topology, while the remaining characters provided insufficient information to reconstruct the placement of the fossil bat taxa with respect to extant families.

Dispersal-Vicariance analysis together with a relaxed Bayesian clock were used to evaluate possible biogeographic scenarios that could account for the current distribution pattern of extant bat families.

Cysteine protease inhibitors arrest infection by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. RNA interference studies implicated a cathepsin B-like protease, tbcatB, as a key inhibitor target. Utilizing parasites in which one of the two alleles of tbcatb has been deleted, the key role of this protease in degradation of endocytosed host proteins is delineated. TbcatB deficiency results in a decreased growth rate and dysmorphism of the flagellar pocket and the subjacent endocytic compartment. Western blot and microscopic analysis indicate that deficiency in tbcatB results in accumulation of both host and parasite proteins, including the lysosomal marker p67. A critical function for parasitism is the degradation of host transferrin, which is necessary for iron acquisition. Substrate specificity analysis of recombinant tbcatB revealed the optimal peptide cleavage sequences for the enzyme and these were confirmed experimentally using FRET-based substrates. Degradation of transferrin was validated by SDS-PAGE and the specific cleavage sites identified by N-terminal sequencing. Because even a modest deficiency in tbcatB is lethal for the parasite, tbcatB is a logical target for the development of new anti-trypanosomal chemotherapy.","website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2570886&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2570886","other":"28934","pmid":"18701454","pmc_id":"2570886","doi":"10.1074\/jbc.M805824200"},"stats":{"readers":7,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":14},{"name":"Czech Republic","value":14},{"name":"Argentina","value":14}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":29},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":29},{"name":"Senior Lecturer","value":14}]},"issue":"43","pages":"28934-28943","public_file_hash":"af7dcfc6320d3f1562a90f168cb3bca06fe7b833","publication_outlet":"The Journal of Biological Chemistry","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-parasite-cysteine-protease-is-key-to-host-protein-degradation-and-iron-acquisition\/","publisher":"American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","uuid":"aabc3790-6d05-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Theresa C","surname":"O'Brien"},{"forename":"Zachary B","surname":"Mackey"},{"forename":"Richard D","surname":"Fetter"},{"forename":"Youngchool","surname":"Choe"},{"forename":"Anthony J","surname":"O'Donoghue"},{"forename":"Min","surname":"Zhou"},{"forename":"Charles S","surname":"Craik"},{"forename":"Conor R","surname":"Caffrey"},{"forename":"James H","surname":"McKerrow"}],"title":"A Parasite Cysteine Protease Is Key to Host Protein Degradation and Iron Acquisition*S","volume":"283","year":2008,"categories":[455,43,47,352],"groups":[{"profile_id":167562,"date_added":1280679217000,"group_id":376401}],"oa_journal":false},"87c56620-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"We present the most comprehensive analysis of higher-level relationships in gall wasps conducted thus far. The analysis was based on detailed study of the skeletal morphology of adults, resulting in 164 phylogenetically informative characters, complemented with a few biological characters. Thirty-seven cynipid species from thirty-one genera, including four genera of the apparently monophyletic Cynipini and almost all of the genera in the other tribes, were examined. The outgroup included exemplar species from three successively more distant cynipoid families: Figitidae (the sister group of the Cynipidae), Liopteridae and Ibaliidae. There was considerable homoplasy in the data, but many groupings in the shortest tree were nonetheless well supported, as indicated by bootstrap proportions and decay indices. Partitioning of the data suggested that the high level of homoplasy is characteristic of the Cynipidae and not the result of the amount of available phylogenetically conservative characters being exhausted. The analysis supported the monophyly of the Cynipini (oak gall wasps) which, together with the Rhoditini (the rose gall wasps), Eschatocerini and Pediaspidini formed a larger monophyletic group of gall inducers restricted to woody representatives of the eudicot subclass Rosidae. The inquilines (Synergini) were indicated to be monophyletic, whereas the Aylacini, primarily herb gall inducers, appeared as a paraphyletic assemblage of basal cynipid groups. The shortest tree suggests that the Cynipidae can be divided into three major lineages: one including the inquilines, the Aylacini genera associated with Rosaceae, and Liposthenes; one consisting entirely of Aylacini genera, among them Aulacidea, Isocolus and Neaylax; and one comprising the woody rosid gallers (the oak and rose gall wasps and allies), the Phanacis- Timaspis complex and the Aylacini genera associated with Papaveraceae.","identifiers":{"issn":"03076970","doi":"10.1046\/j.1365-3113.1998.00053.x"},"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1046\/j.1365-3113.1998.00053.x","stats":{"readers":14,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":93},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":7}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":29},{"name":"","value":14},{"name":"Canada","value":14}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":21},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":14},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":14}]},"issue":"3","pages":"229-252","publication_outlet":"Systematic Entomology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diversity-and-phylogeny-of-wolbachia-infecting-bactrocera-dorsalis-diptera-tephritidae-populations-from-china\/","uuid":"87c56620-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"J","surname":"Liljeblad"},{"forename":"F","surname":"Ronquist"}],"title":"A phylogenetic analysis of higher-level gall wasp relationships (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae)","volume":"23","year":1998,"categories":[32,48,201,52,43],"groups":[{"profile_id":3083691,"date_added":1299878981000,"group_id":701981},{"profile_id":5724,"date_added":1292278255000,"group_id":734351}],"oa_journal":false},"6a9683b0-6d04-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"A formal classification of the land plants that is compatible with the APG III classification is proposed.

There is strong support for the monophyly of the Tremellomycetes, and its position as the sister group of the rest of the Agaricomycotina. Dacrymycetes and Agaricomycetes also are supported strongly, and together they form a clade that is equivalent to the Hymenomycetidae of Swann and Taylor. The deepest nodes in the Agaricomycetes, which are supported only by Bayesian measures of confidence, suggest that the Sebacinales, Cantharellales and Auriculariales are among the most ancient lineages. For the first time, the Polyporales are strongly supported as monophyletic and are placed as the sister group of the Thelephorales. The Agaricales, Boletales and Atheliales are united as the Agaricomycetidae, and the Russulales might be its sister group. There are still some problematical nodes that will require more loci to be resolved. Phylogenomics has promise for reconstructing these difficult backbone nodes, but current genome projects are limited mostly to the Agaricales, Boletales and Polyporales. Genome sequences from other major lineages, especially the early diverging clades, are needed to resolve the most ancient nodes and to assess deep homology in ecological characters in the Agaricomycotina.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17486968","identifiers":{"pmid":"17486968"},"stats":{"readers":14,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":93},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":7}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":21},{"name":"Ecuador","value":7},{"name":"Korea (South)","value":7}],"status":[{"name":"Professor","value":29},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":21},{"name":"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)","value":14}]},"issue":"6","pages":"917-925","publication_outlet":"Mycologia","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-phylogenetic-overview-of-the-agaricomycotina\/","publisher":"Mycol Soc America","uuid":"085b15f0-6d07-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"David S","surname":"Hibbett"}],"title":"A phylogenetic overview of the Agaricomycotina.","volume":"98","year":2006,"categories":[36,43,210,45,35,201,352],"groups":[{"profile_id":4708681,"date_added":1303983532000,"group_id":1074221},{"profile_id":5724,"date_added":1292278255000,"group_id":734351}],"oa_journal":false},"3c8bd9b0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2556411","other":"3777","pmid":"18695216","pmc_id":"2556411","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0801962105"},"stats":{"readers":92,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":84},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":13},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"Panama","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":27}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":37},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":11}]},"issue":"Supplement_1","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","uuid":"3c8bd9b0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Michael J","surname":"Donoghue"}],"chapter":"11549","title":"A phylogenetic perspective on the distribution of plant diversity","year":2008,"groups":[{"profile_id":4696391,"date_added":1303865789000,"group_id":1069531},{"profile_id":2017171,"date_added":1299163789000,"group_id":926511},{"profile_id":1547841,"date_added":1298247298000,"group_id":896311},{"profile_id":27624,"date_added":1284405033000,"group_id":440691}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"Phylogenetic studies are revealing that major ecological niches are more conserved through evolutionary history than expected, implying that adaptations to major climate changes have not readily been accomplished in all lineages.

Using time series data from a Northwest Atlantic estuary, we show that the phenology of a top zooplankton predator, the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, has shifted more in response to climate warming over the past ~50 years than that of its major prey species, the copepod Acartia tonsa. Before climatic warming, A. tonsa was the dominant secondary producer in the estuary and its main period of production occurred before the seasonal appearance of M. leidyi. However, since 2000, the seasonal peak abundances of the two species have overlapped, intensifying the predator-prey relationship and resulting in the near extirpation of the once-abundant copepod from the estuary. We propose that the physical mechanism driving the different phenological responses of the two species is differential spring warming of the winter refugia of these two species. Substantial amplification of warming patterns in shallow embayments affects overwintering M. leidyi but has little influence over seasonal excystment of overwintering A. tonsa eggs located in the broader, deeper regions of the Bay. In this way, large-scale climatic changes are expressed as local-scale temperature variations that differentially affect alternate planktonic life histories to produce novel spring population growth dynamics of the two species and, ultimately, a new summer planktonic community dynamic in Narragansett Bay.","identifiers":{"issn":"01427873","doi":"10.1093\/plankt\/fbl042"},"website":"http:\/\/www.plankt.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1093\/plankt\/fbl042","stats":{"readers":15,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":73},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":13},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":13}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":20},{"name":"Portugal","value":7},{"name":"Estonia","value":7}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":40},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":20},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":13}]},"issue":"11","pages":"1099-1105","publication_outlet":"Journal of Plankton Research","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-physicalbiological-interaction-underlying-variable-phenological-responses-to-climate-change-by-coastal-zooplankton\/","uuid":"6f9f25e0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"J H","surname":"Costello"},{"forename":"B K","surname":"Sullivan"},{"forename":"D J","surname":"Gifford"}],"title":"A physical-biological interaction underlying variable phenological responses to climate change by coastal zooplankton","volume":"28","year":2006,"categories":[119,201,36,52,455,43,40,210,120],"groups":[{"profile_id":3083151,"date_added":1291063847000,"group_id":709171}],"oa_journal":false},"b1a10940-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Taxonomy underpins all biological research, with implications for many basic scientific and applied fields. Insights into the stability or change of animal and plant guilds require species identification on a broad scale and biodiversity questions have become a major public issue. But this domes at a time when taxonomy is facing a crisis, because ever fewer specialists are available. Here, we explore the possibility of using DNA-based methodology to overcome these problems. The utility of DNA sequences for taxonomic purposes is well established. However, all current taxonomic approaches intend to use DNA, at best, as an auxiliary criterion for identifying a species or a taxon, but have not given it a central role. We propose a scheme in which DNA would be the scaffold of a taxonomic reference system, whilst maintaining the importance of the morphological information associated with whole specimens.","website":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0169534702000411","identifiers":{"issn":"01695347","doi":"10.1016\/S0169-5347(02)00041-1"},"stats":{"readers":112,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":96},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":14},{"name":"Portugal","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":13},{"name":"Post Doc","value":13}]},"issue":"2","pages":"70-74","publication_outlet":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-plea-for-dna-taxonomy\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"b1a10940-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"D","surname":"Tautz"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Arctander"},{"forename":"Alessandro","surname":"Minelli"},{"forename":"Richard H","surname":"Thomas"},{"forename":"Alfried P","surname":"Vogler"}],"title":"A plea for DNA taxonomy","volume":"18","year":2003,"categories":[34,35,32,201,39,203,43,40,41,46,47,44,462,48,21,52,455,29,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":3607851,"date_added":1296565252000,"group_id":843411},{"profile_id":38323,"date_added":1280798529000,"group_id":363961},{"profile_id":12451,"date_added":1242671333000,"group_id":1513}],"oa_journal":false},"58ce6380-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"pmid":"18511918"},"stats":{"readers":132,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":59},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":18},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":14}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":41},{"name":"Taiwan","value":1},{"name":"Korea (South)","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":46},{"name":"Post Doc","value":17},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":9}]},"issue":"6","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Nature Methods","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"58ce6380-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Rahul","surname":"Roy"},{"forename":"Sungchul","surname":"Hohng"},{"forename":"Taekjip","surname":"Ha"}],"chapter":"507","title":"A practical guide to single-molecule FRET.","year":2008,"groups":[{"profile_id":5077171,"date_added":1306276171000,"group_id":1143541},{"profile_id":2789861,"date_added":1301595085000,"group_id":620471},{"profile_id":2291221,"date_added":1283381462000,"group_id":421771},{"profile_id":2081101,"date_added":1283324958000,"group_id":420481},{"profile_id":323701,"date_added":1267537797000,"group_id":148851}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is one of the most general and adaptable single-molecule techniques.

Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences.

Understanding pluripotency at the molecular level should illuminate fundamental properties of stem cells and the process of cellular reprogramming. Through cell fusion the embryonic cell phenotype can be imposed on somatic cells, a process promoted by the homeodomain protein Nanog, which is central to the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency. Nanog is thought to function in concert with other factors such as Oct4 (ref. 8) and Sox2 (ref. 9) to establish ES cell identity. Here we explore the protein network in which Nanog operates in mouse ES cells. Using affinity purification of Nanog under native conditions followed by mass spectrometry, we have identified physically associated proteins. In an iterative fashion we also identified partners of several Nanog-associated proteins (including Oct4), validated the functional relevance of selected newly identified components and constructed a protein interaction network. The network is highly enriched for nuclear factors that are individually critical for maintenance of the ES cell state and co-regulated on differentiation. The network is linked to multiple co-repressor pathways and is composed of numerous proteins whose encoding genes are putative direct transcriptional targets of its members. This tight protein network seems to function as a cellular module dedicated to pluripotency.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17093407","identifiers":{"pmid":"17093407"},"stats":{"readers":124,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":86},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":9},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"","value":1},{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":31}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":11}]},"issue":"7117","pages":"364-368","public_file_hash":"d80cd6a887eaeeb14efeca8206230d37406533b2","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-protein-interaction-network-for-pluripotency-of-embryonic-stem-cells\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"0232b770-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Jianlong","surname":"Wang"},{"forename":"Sridhar","surname":"Rao"},{"forename":"Jianlin","surname":"Chu"},{"forename":"Xiaohua","surname":"Shen"},{"forename":"Dana N","surname":"Levasseur"},{"forename":"Thorold W","surname":"Theunissen"},{"forename":"Stuart H","surname":"Orkin"}],"title":"A protein interaction network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.","volume":"444","year":2006,"categories":[35,342,43,193,44,85,84,462,80,25,455,335,89,28,331,31,30,35],"groups":[{"profile_id":2218001,"date_added":1293054078000,"group_id":753541},{"profile_id":243432,"date_added":1278496929000,"group_id":342121}],"oa_journal":false},"251978c0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["proteomics","ubiquitylation- ubiquitination"],"abstract":"There is a growing need for techniques that can identify and characterize protein modifications on a large or global scale.

We set up quality criteria, based on extended cross-validation and re-sampling techniques, to quantify the relevance of factorial method results. We target PCA on mean product scores, and several MANOVA models. We used assessor cross-validation and assessor re-sampling to evaluate respectively the impact of each assessor and the impact of the panel make-up on the product results. PCA and simple MANOVA models are highly robust, whereas complex MANOVA models lead to unstable results.","keywords":["cross validation","manova","pca","qda","re sampling","robustness","sensory profile","sharpness"],"website":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/B6T6T-439VBKM-H\/2\/d17e251aedba44f305c158d54db5150f","identifiers":{"issn":"09503293","doi":"10.1016\/S0950-3293(01)00030-1"},"stats":{"readers":4,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":50},{"name":"Slovakia","value":25},{"name":"Switzerland","value":25}],"status":[{"name":"Associate Professor","value":50},{"name":"Other Professional","value":25},{"name":"Post Doc","value":25}]},"issue":"5-7","pages":"393-406","publication_outlet":"Food Quality and Preference","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quality-measurement-sensory-profile-analysis-contribution-extended-crossvalidation-resampling-techniques\/","uuid":"2cb3fbf0-2d88-11e0-bce8-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Romain","surname":"Monrozier"},{"forename":"Marc","surname":"Danzart"}],"title":"A quality measurement for sensory profile analysis The contribution of extended cross-validation and resampling techniques","volume":"12","year":2001,"categories":[33,43],"groups":[{"profile_id":571201,"date_added":1297435001000,"group_id":873471},{"profile_id":3594741,"date_added":1297159712000,"group_id":836571}],"oa_journal":false},"3cb53e30-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"The authors have developed a statistical method for describing relationships among species and higher systematic categories. The method is based on an analysis of a matrix of species--species correlation coefficients computed from a large number of characters for each species and has been called the weighted variable group method. Diagrams of relationships resembling phylogenetic trees are constructed and, on the assumption that morphological resemblance is with certain exceptions inversely related to amount of evolutionary divergence, phylogenetic relationships may be hypothesized. The method is applied to a group of four genera of bees in the family Megachilidae. One hundred and twenty-two characters were studied for 97 species of this group. Relationships between the species in this study as visualized by Michener before the statistical analysis are compared with relationships as found in the analysis by Sokal. Good agreement between the two sets of data is found. The few exceptions to this rule are discussed. Some changes in the classification of these bees are made as a result of the analysis and two new subgenera are named. However, the paper serves primarily to illustrate a method that can be used to remove some of the subjective bias from taxonomy.","website":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/2406046","identifiers":{"issn":"00143820","doi":"10.2307\/2406046"},"stats":{"readers":8,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":63},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":13},{"id":15,"name":"Linguistics","value":13}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":25},{"name":"Brazil","value":13},{"name":"Spain","value":25}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":38},{"name":"Professor","value":25},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":13}]},"issue":"2","pages":"130-162","publication_outlet":"Evolution","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-quantitative-approach-to-a-problem-in-classification\/","publisher":"Society for the Study of Evolution","uuid":"3cb53e30-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"C D","surname":"Michener"},{"forename":"R R","surname":"Sokal"}],"title":"A quantitative approach to a problem in classification","volume":"11","year":1957,"categories":[424,257,455,43,40,210],"oa_journal":false},"74886e50-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:1392413","pmid":"12991237","pmc_id":"1392413"},"stats":{"readers":194,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":49},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":12},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":10}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":31},{"name":"Hong Kong","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":42},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":15},{"name":"Post Doc","value":10}]},"issue":"4","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"The Journal of Physiology","publisher":"Physiological Soc","uuid":"74886e50-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"A L","surname":"Hodgkin"},{"forename":"A F","surname":"Huxley"}],"title":"A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve","year":1952,"groups":[{"profile_id":68202,"date_added":1292346263000,"group_id":736941},{"profile_id":1152241,"date_added":1291455525000,"group_id":713321},{"profile_id":1152241,"date_added":1291322213000,"group_id":692651},{"profile_id":1889,"date_added":1283591499000,"group_id":537401},{"profile_id":237722,"date_added":1281528072000,"group_id":390701},{"profile_id":588521,"date_added":1267118159000,"group_id":506261},{"profile_id":443581,"date_added":1263733107000,"group_id":84661},{"profile_id":443581,"date_added":1262911206000,"group_id":80821},{"profile_id":26990,"date_added":0,"group_id":160291}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"This article concludes a series of papers concerned with the flow of electric current through the surface membrane of a giant nerve fibre (Hodgkin, Huxley & Katz, 1952; Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952 a-c).

In practice, the principles behind organizing and documenting computational experiments are often learned on the fly, and this learning is strongly influenced by personal predilections as well as by chance interactions with collaborators or colleagues. The purpose of this article is to describe one good strategy for carrying out computational experiments. I will not describe profound issues such as how to formulate hypotheses, design experiments, or draw conclusions. Rather, I will focus on relatively mundane issues such as organizing files and directories and documenting progress. These issues are important because poor organizational choices can lead to significantly slower research progress. I do not claim that the strategies I outline here are optimal.

The presence of a marker, usually antibiotic- or herbicide-resistance, allows identification of transformed seedlings from untransformed seedlings. Seedling selection is a lengthy process which does not always lead to easily identifiable transformants. Selection for kanamycin-, phosphinothricin- and hygromycin B-resistance commonly takes 710 d and high seedling density and fungal contamination may result in failure to recover transformants. Results: A method for identifying transformed seedlings in as little as 3.25 d has been developed. Arabidopsis T1 seeds obtained after floral dip transformation are plated on 1% agar containing MS medium and kanamycin, phosphinothricin or hygromycin B, as appropriate. After a 2-d stratification period, seeds are subjected to a regime of 46 h light, 48 h dark and 24 h light (3.25 d). Kanamycin-resistant and phosphinothricin-resistant seedlings are easily distinguished from non-resistant seedlings by green expanded cotyledons whereas non-resistant seedlings have pale unexpanded cotyledons. Seedlings grown on hygromycin B differ from those grown on kanamycin and phosphinothricin as both resistant and non-resistant seedlings are green. However, hygromycin B-resistant seedlings are easily identified as they have long hypocotyls (0.81.0 cm) whereas non-resistant seedlings have short hypocotyls (0.20.4 cm). Conclusion: The method presented here is an improvement on current selection methods as it allows quicker identification of transformed seedlings: transformed seedlings are easily discernable from non-transformants in as little as 3.25 d in comparison to the 710 d required for selection using current protocols.","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:1636043","other":"1746-4811-2-19","pmid":"17087829","pmc_id":"1636043","doi":"10.1186\/1746-4811-2-19"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17087829","stats":{"readers":42,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":5},{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"Spain","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":45},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":14},{"name":"Post Doc","value":12}]},"pages":"19","public_file_hash":"0a8323ab0735c93186bdd13b8370bf7c48f816cd","publication_outlet":"Plant Methods","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-rapid-and-robust-method-of-identifying-transformed-arabidopsis-thaliana-seedlings-following-floral-dip-transformation\/","publisher":"BioMed Central","uuid":"efe1ed00-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Samuel J","surname":"Harrison"},{"forename":"Ellie K","surname":"Mott"},{"forename":"Kate","surname":"Parsley"},{"forename":"Sue","surname":"Aspinall"},{"forename":"John C","surname":"Gray"},{"forename":"Amanda","surname":"Cottage"}],"title":"A rapid and robust method of identifying transformed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings following floral dip transformation","volume":"2","year":2006,"categories":[48,43,28,44],"oa_journal":true},"31a1fb40-a0dd-11df-8892-0024e8453de6":{"abstract":"A protein determination method which involves the binding of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 to protein is described.

However, analyses of such data often ignore potential differences in detection probability. We adapted a removal model to directly estimate detection probability during point-count surveys. The model assumes that singing frequency is a major factor influencing probability of detection when birds are surveyed using point counts. This may be appropriate for surveys in which most detections are by sound. The model requires counts to be divided into several time intervals. Point counts are often conducted for 10 min, where the number of birds recorded is divided into those first observed in the first 3 min, the subsequent 2 min, and the last 5 min. We developed a maximum-likelihood estimator for the detectability of birds recorded during counts divided into those intervals. This technique can easily be adapted to point counts divided into intervals of any length. We applied this method to unlimited-radius counts conducted in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We used model selection criteria to identify whether detection probabilities varied among species, throughout the morning, throughout the season, and among different observers. We found differences in detection probability among species. Species that sing frequently such as Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) had high detection probabilities (similar to90%) and species that call infrequently such as Pileated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) had low detection probability (36%). We also found detection probabilities varied with the time of day for some species (e.g. thrushes) and between observers for other species. We used the same approach to estimate detection probability and density for a subset of the observations with limited-radius point counts.

While our main focus is on marine habitat, we extensively draw on knowledge gained in freshwater systems where benthic assessment procedures are at an advanced stage of maturity. We found a broad range of sophistication\/complication in terms of the methods applied in assessing and mapping benthic habitats. The simplest index or metric involved some assessment of species richness, while the most complicated required utilizing multi-variate analysis. The simplest mapping attempts equated physical substrate with benthic habitat while the most sophisticated relied on extensive environmental preference and groundtruth data for species of concern. The leading edge of methods for benthic habitat mapping involves combining the advances in optical and acoustic methods that allow for routine classifying and mapping of the seafloor with biological and habitat data for species of concern. The objective of this melding of dispirit methods is to produce benthic habitat maps with broad system wide coverage and sound biological underpinning. It is clear that the disparity in information density between the physical and biological sides of the equation currently hinder applicability and acceptability of benthic habitat mapping efforts. In addition to the lack of basic information on the biological and environmental tolerances of targeted species, the proliferation of metrics for characterizing and assessing biological conditions further clouds the usefulness of any broad scale mapping attempt. The problem of data density mismatch between physical and biological methods will likely not be solved until acoustic methods can routinely resolve the elusive biological components that make a physical substrate a habitat.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15474734","identifiers":{"pmid":"15474734"},"stats":{"readers":68,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":66},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":18},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":15}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":10},{"name":"United States","value":9},{"name":"Greece","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":35},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":15},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":12}]},"issue":"3","pages":"165-181","publication_outlet":"Journal of Environmental Management","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-review-of-approaches-for-classifying-benthic-habitats-and-evaluating-habitat-quality\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"6c781c50-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Robert J","surname":"Diaz"},{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Solan"},{"forename":"Raymond M","surname":"Valente"}],"title":"A review of approaches for classifying benthic habitats and evaluating habitat quality.","volume":"73","year":2004,"categories":[119,201,39,52,37,43,434,40,29,210,211,120],"groups":[{"profile_id":2962311,"date_added":1306310119000,"group_id":1144391},{"profile_id":25065,"date_added":1274782065000,"group_id":276021}],"oa_journal":false},"743d0610-6d03-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"Surface area measurement is a common component of benthic research, especially in the quantification of chlorophyll.

A literature search of 130 papers indicated the most common methods: using artificial substrates of known area, subsampling a specific area using a template or sampler, measuring stone dimensions and using an equation to derive area, and using the weight of foil wrapped on stones. Methods were compared using spheres of known area, smooth and rough granite stones, and plastic macrophytes. Most methods produced highly correlated measurements and accurately estimated surface area. The wetted layer method was sensitive to stone roughness and plant complexity, but may overestimate the area of complex surfaces. Replication of one method by 10 biologists indicated that individual differences in technique can affect surface area values.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A qualitative risk assessment for microbiological hazards in fresh fruit was carried out based on the Codex Alimentarius (Codex) framework, modified to consider multiple hazards and all fresh (whole) fruits. The assessment determines 14 significant bacterial, viral, protozoal and nematodal hazards associated with fresh produce, assesses the probable level of exposure from fresh fruit, concludes on the risk from each hazard, and considers and recommends risk management actions. A review of potential risk management options allowed the comparison of effectiveness with the potential exposure to each hazard. CONCLUSIONS: Washing to a recommended protocol is an appropriate risk management action for the vast majority of consumption events, particularly when good agricultural and hygienic practices are followed and with the addition of refrigerated storage for low acid fruit. Additional safeguards are recommended for aggregate fruits with respect to the risk from protozoa.

However, RNAi tools for the chicken embryo have largely been adapted from vectors designed for mammalian cells. Here we present plasmid and retroviral RNAi vectors specifically designed for optimal gene silencing in chicken cells. The vectors use a chicken U6 promoter to express RNAs modelled on microRNA30, which are embedded within chicken microRNA operon sequences to ensure optimal Drosha and Dicer processing of transcripts. The chicken U6 promoter works significantly better than promoters of mammalian origin and in combination with a microRNA operon expression cassette (MOEC), achieves up to 90% silencing of target genes. By using a MOEC, we show that it is also possible to simultaneously silence two genes with a single vector. The vectors express either RFP or GFP markers, allowing simple in vivo tracking of vector delivery. Using these plasmids, we demonstrate effective silencing of Pax3, Pax6, Nkx2.1, Nkx2.2, Notch1 and Shh in discrete regions of the chicken embryonic nervous system.

describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed. The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.","tags":["female","homozygote","humans","male"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17943122","pages":"851-861","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-second-generation-human-haplotype-map-of-over-31-million-snps\/","volume":"449","categories":[342,414,193,326,462,21,320,334,455,25,385,27,26,29,28,331,30,90,329,103,35,101,38,43,434,40,46,44,119,353,355,52,176,300,303,35]},"702ee040-0342-11e0-95f0-0024e8453de6":{"tags":["dopamine","reward","jc blitz"],"abstract":"Individuals make choices and prioritize goals using complex processes that assign value to rewards and associated stimuli. During Pavlovian learning, previously neutral stimuli that predict rewards can acquire motivational properties, becoming attractive and desirable incentive stimuli. However, whether a cue acts solely as a predictor of reward, or also serves as an incentive stimulus, differs between individuals. Thus, individuals vary in the degree to which cues bias choice and potentially promote maladaptive behaviour. Here we use rats that differ in the incentive motivational properties they attribute to food cues to probe the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in stimulus-reward learning. We show that intact dopamine transmission is not required for all forms of learning in which reward cues become effective predictors. Rather, dopamine acts selectively in a form of stimulus-reward learning in which incentive salience is assigned to reward cues. In individuals with a propensity for this form of learning, reward cues come to powerfully motivate and control behaviour. This work provides insight into the neurobiology of a form of stimulus-reward learning that confers increased susceptibility to disorders of impulse control.","website":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nature09588","identifiers":{"nihms_id":"245936","pmid":"21150898","pmc_id":"3058375"},"stats":{"readers":125,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":59},{"id":22,"name":"Psychology","value":21},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":12}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"United States","value":26},{"name":"Austria","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":42},{"name":"Post Doc","value":20},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":8}]},"issue":"7328","pages":"53-57","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-role-dopamine-stimulusreward-learning\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"702ee040-0342-11e0-95f0-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Shelly B","surname":"Flagel"},{"forename":"Jeremy J","surname":"Clark"},{"forename":"Terry E","surname":"Robinson"},{"forename":"Leah","surname":"Mayo"},{"forename":"Alayna","surname":"Czuj"},{"forename":"Ingo","surname":"Willuhn"},{"forename":"Christina A","surname":"Akers"},{"forename":"Sarah M","surname":"Clinton"},{"forename":"Paul E M","surname":"Phillips"},{"forename":"Huda","surname":"Akil"}],"title":"A selective role for dopamine in stimulus-reward learning.","volume":"469","year":2011,"categories":[35,411,101,38,67,43,403,166,225,405,462,80,398,23,397,25,455,24,335,419,385,331,90,422,352,350,302],"groups":[{"profile_id":2644611,"date_added":1302522042000,"group_id":935561},{"profile_id":24031,"date_added":1302075924000,"group_id":491791},{"profile_id":1888831,"date_added":1299985493000,"group_id":562451},{"profile_id":2561021,"date_added":1297423679000,"group_id":472591},{"profile_id":38152,"date_added":1297068965000,"group_id":858931},{"profile_id":198142,"date_added":1294915135000,"group_id":791241},{"profile_id":3037821,"date_added":1293663491000,"group_id":760041}],"oa_journal":false},"a5b6e630-6d07-11df-a474-0026b95e3e23":{"abstract":"We have assembled a sequence database for 80 genera of Basidiomycota from the Hymenomycete lineage (sensu Swann & Taylor 1993) for a small region of the mitochondrial large subunit rRNA gene. Our taxonomic sample is highly biased toward known ectomycorrhizal (EM) taxa, but also includes some related saprobic species. This gene fragment can be amplified directly from mycorrhizae, sequenced, and used to determine the family or subfamily of many unknown mycorrhizal basidiomycetes. The method is robust to minor sequencing errors, minor misalignments, and method of phylogenetic analysis. Evolutionary inferences are limited by the small size and conservative nature of the gene fragment. Nevertheless two interesting patterns emerge: (i) the switch between ectomycorrhizae and saprobic lifestyles appears to have happened convergently several and perhaps many times; and (ii) at least five independent lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi are characterized by very short branch lengths. We estimate that two of these groups radiated in the mid-Tertiary, and we speculate that these radiations may have been caused by the expanding geographical range of their host trees during this period.

A total of 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 134 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general, expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, indicating that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease.

A current challenge is to understand how FGF signalling generates such diverse outcomes. A key FGF downstream pathway is the Ras-MAPK\/Erk1\/2 cascade, which culminates in the phosphorylation of target proteins, such as the Ets family of transcription factors. To begin to assess specificity downstream of FGF in the chick embryo we have characterised the patterns of Fgfr1-4 expression and Erk1\/2 activation, as well as expression of the Erk1\/2 specific phosphatase, Mkp3 and of three Ets factor genes (Erm, Pea3 and Er81) from early blastula to the 10 somite stage. We identify new sites of Fgfr expression and show that nearly all regions of Erk1\/2 activity are within Fgfr expression domains and require FGF signalling. Differences in intensity, duration, distribution and sub-cellular localisation of activated Erk1\/2 are observed in distinct cell populations within the embryo and during wound healing. With few exceptions, a tight correspondence between Erk1\/2 activation and Mkp3 expression is found, while specific combinations of Ets factors are associated with distinct regions of Erk1\/2 activation. These findings provide a comprehensive spatial and temporal map of FGF\/Erk1\/2 activity during early chick development and identify region and tissue specific differences in expression of Fgfrs as well as Erk1\/2 phosphorylation and transcriptional targets which help to define response specificity.","identifiers":{"pmid":"17123506"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17123506","stats":{"readers":16,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":13},{"name":"Portugal","value":19},{"name":"United States","value":19}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":31},{"name":"Post Doc","value":25},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":13}]},"issue":"2","pages":"536-552","publication_outlet":"Developmental Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-spatial-and-temporal-map-of-fgferk12-activity-and-response-repertoires-in-the-early-chick-embryo\/","uuid":"afe8aae0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"J Simon","surname":"Lunn"},{"forename":"Katherine J","surname":"Fishwick"},{"forename":"Pam A","surname":"Halley"},{"forename":"Kate G","surname":"Storey"}],"title":"A spatial and temporal map of FGF\/Erk1\/2 activity and response repertoires in the early chick embryo.","volume":"302","year":2007,"categories":[43,31,30,352],"groups":[{"profile_id":13719,"date_added":1242314588000,"group_id":1580}],"oa_journal":false},"cd52ac20-f988-11df-95f0-0024e8453de6":{"identifiers":{"issn":"13669516","doi":"10.1111\/j.1472-4642.2010.00725.x"},"stats":{"readers":158,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":69},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":27},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"United States","value":28},{"name":"Philippines","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":39},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":19},{"name":"Post Doc","value":9}]},"issue":"1","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Diversity and Distributions","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","uuid":"cd52ac20-f988-11df-95f0-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Jane","surname":"Elith"},{"forename":"Steven J","surname":"Phillips"},{"forename":"Trevor","surname":"Hastie"},{"forename":"Miroslav","surname":"Dud\u00edk"},{"forename":"Yung En","surname":"Chee"},{"forename":"Colin J","surname":"Yates"}],"title":"A statistical explanation of MaxEnt for ecologists","year":2010,"groups":[{"profile_id":1814041,"date_added":1304785881000,"group_id":1078361},{"profile_id":4345171,"date_added":1301881507000,"group_id":1008781},{"profile_id":21978,"date_added":1299849736000,"group_id":947951},{"profile_id":171132,"date_added":1299253031000,"group_id":38322},{"profile_id":1466881,"date_added":1297749975000,"group_id":259051},{"profile_id":2322581,"date_added":1295976051000,"group_id":825351},{"profile_id":393791,"date_added":1291190270000,"group_id":605081}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"MaxEnt is a program for modelling species distributions from presence-only species records.

The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies.","tags":["maxent"],"keywords":["absence","ecological niche","entropy","machine learning","presence only","species"],"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1472-4642.2010.00725.x","pages":"no-no","public_file_hash":"4855a8f74f508d0124550a07a23f13a7ddd9897b","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/statistical-explanation-maxent-ecologists\/","volume":"17","categories":[34,204,35,32,201,36,203,37,43,40,46,44,119,48,320,23,52,455,26,208,29,209,210,90]},"03b4e9a0-6d0b-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"A user-friendly Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP) was recently developed in a joint effort by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the University of Georgia. SVAP was designed to be an introductory screening-level assessment method for people unfamiliar with stream assessments. It was designed for use by NRCS field staff who work with agricultural landowners. NRCS is in a key position to influence conservation practices since the organization works with private stakeholders, maintaining more than 2000 field offices throughout the U.S. with a central office in each state. The SVAP measures a maximum of 15 elements and is based on visual inspection of the physical and biological characteristics of instream and riparian environments. Each element is assigned a numerical score relative to reference conditions and an overall score for the stream reach is calculated. A qualitative description of the stream reach is made based on overall numerical score. While SVAP is not intended to replace more robust stream assessment protocols, it provides quick and reliable information for use in NRCS farm assistance programs. It is also an educational tool through which landowners can learn about conservation of aquatic resources.

These IBIs were designed to be applicable across multistate regions as part of a national assessment of all U.S. waters. Here, we present additional steps in, and refinements to, that IBI development process. We used fish and amphibian assemblage data from 932 stream and river sites in 12 western U.S. states to develop IBIs for Mountains, Xeric, and Plains ecoregions. We divided 237 candidate metrics into nine metric classes representing different attributes of assemblage structure and function. For each ecoregion we sequentially eliminated metrics by testing metric range, signal-to-noise ratios, responsiveness to disturbance, and redundancy to select the best metric in each class. The IBIs for the Mountains and Plains each had seven metrics and the Xeric IBI had five. In the Mountains, half of the estimated stream length that could be assessed had IBI scores greater than 62 (out of 100). In the Xeric and Plains, half the stream length had scores no greater than 50 and no greater than 37, respectively. An estimated 16% of Xeric stream length had scores greater than 62 (the median for the Mountains), while 5% of Plains stream length had scores that exceeded 62. This IBI development process is less subjective and more streamlined and has more clearly defined criteria for metric selection and scoring than those used in the past, while maintaining a strong ecological foundation.","identifiers":{"issn":"00028487","doi":"10.1577\/T06-128.1"},"website":"http:\/\/afsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1577\/T06-128.1","stats":{"readers":17,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":71},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":29}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":35},{"name":"Finland","value":12},{"name":"Brazil","value":29}],"status":[{"name":"Professor","value":18},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":12},{"name":"Post Doc","value":12}]},"issue":"3","pages":"718-735","publication_outlet":"Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-structured-approach-for-developing-indices-of-biotic-integrity-three-examples-from-streams-and-rivers-in-the-western-usa\/","uuid":"81461ef0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Thomas R","surname":"Whittier"},{"forename":"Robert M","surname":"Hughes"},{"forename":"John L","surname":"Stoddard"},{"forename":"Gregg A","surname":"Lomnicky"},{"forename":"David V","surname":"Peck"},{"forename":"Alan T","surname":"Herlihy"}],"title":"A Structured Approach for Developing Indices of Biotic Integrity: Three Examples from Streams and Rivers in the Western USA","volume":"136","year":2007,"categories":[207,39,23,37,43,26,208,210],"oa_journal":false},"3c503ad0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Farris, J.

We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies. Our survey revealed 20 fragmentation experiments worldwide. Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) of particular species. Other important themes were the effect of fragmentation in interspecific interactions, the role of corridors and landscape connectivity in individual movements and species richness, and the influences of edge effects on ecosystem services. Our comparisons showed a remarkable lack of consistency in results across studies, especially with regard to species richness and abundance relative to fragment size. Experiments with arthropods showed the best fit with theoretical expectations of greater species richness on larger fragments. Highly mobile taxa such as birds and mammals, early-successional plant species, long-lived species, and generalist predators did not respond in the \"expected\" manner. Reasons for these discrepancies included edge effects, competitive release in the habitat fragments, and the spatial scale of the experiments. One of the more consistently supported hypotheses was that movement and species richness are positively affected by corridors and connectivity, respectively. Transient effects dominated many systems; for example, crowding of individuals on fragments commonly was observed after fragmentation, followed by a relaxation toward lower abundance in subsequent years. The three long-term studies (greater than or equal to 14 years) revealed strong patterns that would have been missed in short-term investigations. Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for elucidation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potential for changing responses to fragmentation over time.","website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1046\/j.1523-1739.2000.98081.x","identifiers":{"pmid":"86275800003","issn":"08888892","doi":"10.1046\/j.1523-1739.2000.98081.x"},"stats":{"readers":147,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":65},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":32},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":1}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"United States","value":27},{"name":"Spain","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":29},{"name":"Post Doc","value":14},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":11}]},"issue":"2","pages":"342-355","publication_outlet":"Conservation Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-survey-and-overview-of-habitat-fragmentation-experiments\/","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","uuid":"ef5c2d20-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Diane M","surname":"Debinski"},{"forename":"Robert D","surname":"Holt"}],"title":"A Survey and Overview of Habitat Fragmentation Experiments","volume":"14","year":2000,"categories":[35,32,201,140,39,203,37,43,40,193,47,44,119,48,21,23,52,29,123,331,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":2167901,"date_added":1295896632000,"group_id":822441},{"profile_id":3269191,"date_added":1294702676000,"group_id":755281},{"profile_id":2686811,"date_added":1289547633000,"group_id":657721},{"profile_id":27624,"date_added":1284405033000,"group_id":440691},{"profile_id":604081,"date_added":1265403483000,"group_id":557091},{"profile_id":18973,"date_added":0,"group_id":2424}],"oa_journal":false},"479f3d10-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2099490","other":"1471-2105-8-S7-S21","pmid":"18047721","pmc_id":"2099490","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-8-S7-S21"},"stats":{"readers":81,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":79},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":14},{"id":18,"name":"Mathematics","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":27},{"name":"Greece","value":2},{"name":"Spain","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":44},{"name":"Post Doc","value":20},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":10}]},"issue":"Suppl 7","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"BMC Bioinformatics","publisher":"BioMed Central","uuid":"479f3d10-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Modan K","surname":"Das"},{"forename":"Ho-Kwok","surname":"Dai"}],"title":"A survey of DNA motif finding algorithms","year":2007,"groups":[{"profile_id":4345551,"date_added":1301681439000,"group_id":1005061},{"profile_id":1259111,"date_added":1296219787000,"group_id":528931},{"profile_id":1428091,"date_added":1275693963000,"group_id":534371},{"profile_id":593551,"date_added":1269513769000,"group_id":183421},{"profile_id":115252,"date_added":1258588160000,"group_id":46442},{"profile_id":115232,"date_added":1258582490000,"group_id":46432},{"profile_id":19937,"date_added":1253179810000,"group_id":5717}],"oa_journal":true,"abstract":"Background: Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif finding algorithms. Results: Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but perform significantly worse in higher organisms. Conclusion: Despite considerable efforts to date, DNA motif finding remains a complex challenge for biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over motif models.","tags":["de-novo","discovery","finding","motif","review"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18047721","pages":"S21","public_file_hash":"5effd92c9e52af1b8c6b926347b0db42ca20ce5a","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-survey-of-dna-motif-finding-algorithms\/","volume":"8","categories":[101,38,172,43,193,44,48,21,93,455,385,300,30,90,35]},"be95cc40-6d00-11df-8e55-0026b95e43ca":{"tags":["ngs","sequence alignment"],"abstract":"Rapidly evolving sequencing technologies produce data on an unparalleled scale.

We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components.

Here I examine these changes in the discipline of animal behaviour during the past 50 years as reflected in specialized behaviour textbooks and introductory textbooks for general biology courses. Prior to 1975, all the behaviour texts devoted far more coverage to ethological research on the proximate causes of behaviour than to research on the adaptive value of behavioural traits. After 1975, ultimate questions about adaptation received much more attention than they had previously. The change took place because of events in the mid-1960s, including W. D. Hamilton's solution to the evolutionary puzzle of altruism and the group selection debate involving V. C. Wynne-Edwards, G. C. Williams and D. Lack. The effect of these events was to encourage researchers to use sound adaptationist theory untainted by species-benefit thinking. The theory helped identify many new questions about the adaptive value of behavioural traits, stimulating workers to give as much weight to these issues as had previously been devoted to research into the physiology and development of behaviour. Although pure ethological research appeared to decline after 1975, in fact the major proximate concerns of ethology were simply taken on by cell biologists and neurophysiologists who used tools not available to the classic ethologist. The result was the development of neuroethology, which has flourished over the years. However, classic (pre-1975) ethological research still receives considerable coverage in many introductory biology textbooks, possibly because of the weight given these studies by W. T. Keeton in his influential textbook. None the less, ever since the 1980s, most biology textbooks have also discussed some of the fruits of adaptationist theory, especially Hamilton's explanation for altruism, thereby providing a more balanced treatment of proximate and ultimate issues than was once the case.","website":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0003347202920440","identifiers":{"issn":"00033472","doi":"10.1006\/anbe.2002.2044"},"stats":{"readers":25,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":84},{"id":22,"name":"Psychology","value":8},{"id":20,"name":"Philosophy","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":12},{"name":"France","value":4},{"name":"Slovakia","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Post Doc","value":16},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":12}]},"issue":"1","pages":"3-10","publication_outlet":"Animal Behaviour","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-textbook-history-of-animal-behaviour\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"0fa34f40-6d01-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"J","surname":"Alcock"}],"title":"A textbook history of animal behaviour","volume":"65","year":2003,"categories":[411,462,101,23,37,364,43,44],"groups":[{"profile_id":1247101,"date_added":1274891718000,"group_id":227181},{"profile_id":1247101,"date_added":1271254032000,"group_id":227171}],"oa_journal":false},"d2b7d670-6d0d-11df-936c-0026b95e484c":{"identifiers":{"nihms_id":"183888","pmid":"20436457","pmc_id":"2874121"},"stats":{"readers":142,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":86},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":5},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":32},{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":44},{"name":"Post Doc","value":18},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":8}]},"issue":"7296","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Nature","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"d2b7d670-6d0d-11df-936c-0026b95e484c","authors":[{"forename":"Zhijun","surname":"Duan"},{"forename":"Mirela","surname":"Andronescu"},{"forename":"Kevin","surname":"Schutz"},{"forename":"Sean","surname":"McIlwain"},{"forename":"Yoo Jung","surname":"Kim"},{"forename":"Choli","surname":"Lee"},{"forename":"Jay","surname":"Shendure"},{"forename":"Stanley","surname":"Fields"},{"forename":"C Anthony","surname":"Blau"},{"forename":"William S","surname":"Noble"}],"title":"A three-dimensional model of the yeast genome.","year":2010,"groups":[{"profile_id":3336941,"date_added":1301633720000,"group_id":981141},{"profile_id":2426601,"date_added":1291806307000,"group_id":664601},{"profile_id":1868501,"date_added":1286308471000,"group_id":562931},{"profile_id":1812551,"date_added":1284021662000,"group_id":422091},{"profile_id":13561,"date_added":1282089231000,"group_id":398151},{"profile_id":715371,"date_added":1276522473000,"group_id":308441}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"Layered on top of information conveyed by DNA sequence and chromatin are higher order structures that encompass portions of chromosomes, entire chromosomes, and even whole genomes.

In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur.

The molecular structures of Dicer and the Argonaute proteins, free and bound to small RNAs, have offered exciting insights into the molecular mechanisms that are central to RNA silencing pathways.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19158786","identifiers":{"pmid":"19158786"},"stats":{"readers":153,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":78},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":11},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":6}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":20},{"name":"Philippines","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":38},{"name":"Post Doc","value":12},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":11}]},"issue":"7228","pages":"405-412","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a-threedimensional-view-of-the-molecular-machinery-of-rna-interference\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"1358f9b0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Jinek"},{"forename":"Jennifer A","surname":"Doudna"}],"title":"A three-dimensional view of the molecular machinery of RNA interference.","volume":"457","year":2009,"categories":[342,350,193,85,326,462,21,80,25,455,335,27,332,331,28,31,329,90,30,35,519,101,38,311,43,41,44,51,48,35,352],"groups":[{"profile_id":2796841,"date_added":1288878157000,"group_id":622281},{"profile_id":2289951,"date_added":1282852371000,"group_id":412941},{"profile_id":457431,"date_added":1263901861000,"group_id":500051}],"oa_journal":false},"7cd5ef70-bcd7-11df-833d-0024e8453de6":{"abstract":"Proteins can sample conformational states that are critical for function but are seldom detected directly because of their low occupancies and short lifetimes.

To explore the effect of external fluctuations on protein dynamics, we measure the fluctuations in the bulk solvent and the hydration shell with broadband dielectric spectroscopy and compare them with internal fluctuations measured with the M ssbauer effect and neutron scattering. The result is clear. Large-scale protein motions are slaved to the fluctuations in the bulk solvent. They are controlled by the solvent viscosity, and are absent in a solid environment. Internal protein motions are slaved to the beta fluctuations of the hydration shell, are controlled by hydration, and are absent in a dehydrated protein.

Changes in litter quality across the mineralization-soil texture gradient were due to species replacement rather than changes in litter quality within each species. Nitrification was not correlated with aboveground production. Both mineralization and nitrification were highly correlated with humus P content. Differences in nitrification among the soils appeared to be related to P04-P supply in the spring and early summer and to NH4-N supply in mid- to late summer.","website":"http:\/\/www.esajournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2307\/1939478","identifiers":{"issn":"00129658","doi":"10.2307\/1939478"},"stats":{"readers":12,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":75},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":25}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":50},{"name":"France","value":8},{"name":"Czech Republic","value":8}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":33},{"name":"Doctoral Student","value":17},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":8}]},"issue":"1","pages":"256-268","publication_outlet":"Ecology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aboveground-production-n-p-cycling-along-nitrogen-mineralization-gradient-blackhawk-island-wisconsin\/","publisher":"Eco Soc America","uuid":"d4ad6910-6d06-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"John","surname":"Pastor"},{"forename":"John D","surname":"Aber"},{"forename":"Charles A","surname":"McClaugherty"},{"forename":"Jerry M","surname":"Melillo"}],"title":"Aboveground production and N and P cycling along a nitrogen mineralization gradient on Blackhawk Island, Wisconsin","volume":"65","year":1984,"categories":[34,49,201,43,210],"oa_journal":false},"cb672160-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"issn":"15438120","doi":"10.1199\/tab.0058"},"website":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/perlserv\/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1199%2Ftab.0058","stats":{"readers":33,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":97},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":3},{"name":"Philippines","value":3},{"name":"Spain","value":12}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":36},{"name":"Post Doc","value":12},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":12}]},"issue":"1","pages":"1","publication_outlet":"The Arabidopsis Book","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abscisic-acid-biosynthesis-and-response\/","publisher":"The American Society of Plant Biologists","uuid":"cb672160-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Ruth R","surname":"Finkelstein"},{"forename":"Christopher D","surname":"Rock"}],"title":"Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis and Response","volume":"45","year":2002,"categories":[34,48,201,25,43,28,44],"oa_journal":false},"5dc2ef30-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["escherichia coli","acetates","binding sites","chromatography- liquid","escherichia coli proteins","glucose","glycerol","glycolysis"],"abstract":"Absolute metabolite concentrations are critical to a quantitative understanding of cellular metabolism, as concentrations impact both the free energies and rates of metabolic reactions.

The role of food resources (zooplankton) and habitat complexity (expressed by a vegetation structural index) in determining juvenile fish abundance and fish species richness in three morphologically contrasted macrophyte types (Sagittaria, Ceratophyllum and Nuphar) was studied for a large, lowland river. Our results showed that fish abundance increased with food availability, and was maximal for intermediate values of vegetation complexity. Food resources and vegetation complexity did not, however, explain the higher juvenile fish abundance observed in Sagittaria beds. We suggested that plant growth form, acting on fish foraging success and risk of predation, might influence patterns of juvenile fish distribution. Species-abundance relationships were similar among the three macrophyte types, but relationships between number of fish species (fish richness) and number of samples differed. Fish richness in terms of total number of fish species found at each sampling point showed the same pattern as for fish abundance: it increased with food availability and was highest at intermediate vegetation complexities. However, since both fish abundance and fish richness responded in the same manner to food availability and vegetation complexity, we were not able to distinguish statistically any effect for the specific fish richness formulated by the number of fish species per unit fish abundance. The current paradigm that structural complexity of vegetation provides a wider range of niches, increasing species diversity, was thus not verified. This finding indicates a simple species-abundance relationship (the passive sampling hypothesis), and suggests that no special mechanism acts directly on fish species richness.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackwell-synergy.com\/links\/doi\/10.1034%2Fj.1600-0587.2002.250601.x","identifiers":{"issn":"09067590","doi":"10.1034\/j.1600-0587.2002.250601.x"},"stats":{"readers":27,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":52},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":44},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":11},{"name":"Portugal","value":4},{"name":"Slovakia","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":30},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":15},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15}]},"issue":"6","pages":"641-650","publication_outlet":"Ecography","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abundance-and-species-richness-as-a-function-of-food-resources-and-vegetation-structure-juvenile-fish-assemblages-in-rivers\/","publisher":"JSTOR","uuid":"f319b810-6d04-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"G","surname":"Grenouillet"},{"forename":"D","surname":"Pont"},{"forename":"K L","surname":"Seip"}],"title":"Abundance and species richness as a function of food resources and vegetation structure: juvenile fish assemblages in rivers","volume":"25","year":2002,"categories":[201,52,37,43,210,120],"groups":[{"profile_id":1025011,"date_added":1291477680000,"group_id":713581},{"profile_id":37751,"date_added":1271266233000,"group_id":41982},{"profile_id":237292,"date_added":1258083023000,"group_id":528591}],"oa_journal":false},"b06179d0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"The ecological implications of the conversion of old-growth temperate rainforests to managed forests have generated much discussion worldwide. This paper examines the effects of such a conversion on different aspects of the biodiversity of the soil collembolan fauna, and attempts to determine the time that will be required for the collembolan fauna to approach the abundance and community structure seen in old-growth forests. The study also investigates the potential of using different measures of species diversity and community structure as indicators of old-growth conditions in forest soils. The study was carried out in three chronosequence sites in Douglas-fir dominated stands on the dry leeward eastern side of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. Each of the three sites contained stands representing four stages of stand development: regeneration (7-9 years), immature (35-46 years), mature (80-102 years) and old-growth (>248 years). The Collembola were extracted from litterbags containing needle litter or wood chips, and from the forest floor (LFH) layer in the late autumn of four successive years. Overall abundance of Collembola was highest in the old-growth and lowest in the regeneration stands. Although population numbers in the immature and mature forests were significantly higher than in regeneration stands, they still had not achieved the levels observed in old-growth forests. In the forest floor, species richness was low in regeneration stands compared to later stages of stand development, but did not differ significantly among immature, mature and old-growth stands. Measures of species diversity based on Shannon's and Simpson's indices of diversity did not differ significantly according to the stage of stand development. It was not possible to distinguish individual collembolan species that could be used as indicators of old-growth conditions. The same species occurred in most or all stand ages, with differences being determined by changes in relative and absolute abundance of the species comprising the community. However, principal component analysis of data on the Collembola of needle litterbags and the LFH layer showed that the collembolan community of the regeneration stands could be clearly differentiated from those of the forested stands. In addition, the collembolan communities of 80-102-year-old forests could still be distinguished from those of the old-growth forests. In contrast, the collembolan fauna of decomposing wood chips was very similar in all stand ages, with the exception of the regeneration stands. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Most lineages of parasitic helminths are characterized by an amazing diversity of species that complicates the resolution of phylogenetic relationships. Acanthocephalans offer a potential model system to test various long-standing hypotheses and generalizations regarding the evolution of parasitism in metazoans. The entirely parasitic Acanthocephala have a diversity of species that is manageable with regards to constructing global phylogenetic hypotheses, exhibit variation in hosts and habitats, and are hypothesized to have close phylogenetic affinities to the predominately free-living Rotifera. In this paper, I review and test previous hypotheses of acanthocephalan phylogenetic relationships with analyses of the available 18S rRNA sequence database. Maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood inferred trees differ significantly with regard to relationships among acanthocephalans and rotifers. Maximum-parsimony analysis results in a paraphyletic Rotifera, placing a long-branched bdelloid rotifer as the sister taxon of Acanthocephala. Maximum-likelihood analysis results in a monophyletic Rotifera. The difference between the two optimality criteria is attributed to long-branch attraction. The two analyses are congruent in terms of relationships within Acanthocephala.

Although individual impacts from coastal development, degraded water quality, and climate change have been documented, there has been no quantitative global assessment of seagrass loss until now. Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km2 yr1 since 1980 and that 29% of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879. Furthermore, rates of decline have accelerated from a median of 0.9% yr1 before 1940 to 7% yr1 since 1990.

The mechanism of sensitization was examined based on the hypothesis that DETANONOate inhibits a transcription repressor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) that negatively regulates DR5 transcription. Treatment of the prostate carcinoma cell lines with DETANONOate inhibited both NF-kappaB and YY1 DNA-binding activities concomitantly with upregulation of DR5 expression. The direct role of YY1 in the regulation of TRAIL resistance was demonstrated in cells treated with YY1 siRNA resulting in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The role of YY1 in the transcriptional regulation of DR5 was examined in cells treated with a DR5 luciferase reporter system (pDR5) and two constructs, namely, the pDR5\/-605 construct with a deletion of the putative YY1 DNA-binding region (-1224 to -605) and a construct pDR5-YY1 with a mutation of the YY1 DNA-binding site. A significant (3-fold) augmentation of luciferase activity over baseline transfection with pDR5 was observed in cells transfected with the modified constructs. ChIP analysis corroborated the YY1 binding to the DR5 promoter. In vivo, tissues from nude mice bearing the PC-3 xenograft and treated with DETANONOate showed inhibition of YY1 and upregulation of DR5. The present findings demonstrate that YY1 negatively regulates DR5 transcription and expression and these correlated with resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

While several ion transporters contribute to acid-base regulation in fish, the involvement and expression of key transporters under hypercapnia remain to be established. Here, two members of the HCO(3)(-) transporter family (Na(+)\/HCO(3)(-) cotransporter NBC1 and Cl(-)\/HCO(3)(-) exchanger AE1) were described for the first time in gills of marine fish. Benthic eelpout Zoarces viviparus were acclimated to 10,000 ppm CO(2). Hypercapnia did not affect whole animal oxygen consumption over a period of 4 days. During a time series of 6 wk NBC1 mRNA levels first decreased by about 40% (8 to 24 h) but finally increased about threefold over control. mRNA expression of AE1 decreased transiently by 50% at day 4 but recovered to control levels only. Reduced mRNA levels were also found for two Na(+)\/H(+) exchangers (NHE1A, NHE1B) during the first days (by 50-60% at days 1 and 2), followed by restoration of control levels. This pattern was mirrored in a slight decrease of NHE1 protein contents and its subsequent recovery. In contrast, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase mRNA and protein contents, as well as maximum activity, rose steadily from the onset of hypercapnia, and reached up to twofold control levels at the end. These results indicate shifting acclimation patterns between short- and long-term CO(2) exposures. Overall, ion gradient-dependent transporter mRNA levels were transiently downregulated in the beginning of the disturbance. Upregulation of NBC1 on long timescales stresses the importance of this transporter in the hypercapnia response of marine teleosts. Long-term rearrangements include Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase at higher densities and capacities, indicating a shift to elevated rates of ion and acid-base regulation under environmental hypercapnia.","identifiers":{"pmid":"18799636"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18799636","stats":{"readers":10,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":90},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":10}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":10},{"name":"Portugal","value":10},{"name":"Bahamas","value":10}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":30},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":30},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":10}]},"issue":"5","pages":"R1660-R1670","publication_outlet":"American journal of physiology Regulatory integrative and comparative physiology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acclimation-of-ion-regulatory-capacities-in-gills-of-marine-fish-under-environmental-hypercapnia\/","uuid":"42dbd9e0-6d06-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Katrin","surname":"Deigweiher"},{"forename":"Nils","surname":"Koschnick"},{"forename":"Hans-Otto","surname":"P\u00f6rtner"},{"forename":"Magnus","surname":"Lucassen"}],"title":"Acclimation of ion regulatory capacities in gills of marine fish under environmental hypercapnia.","volume":"295","year":2008,"categories":[201,43,24,40,35,352],"oa_journal":false},"314d5e30-e1ad-11df-874c-0024e8453de6":{"abstract":"Eosinophils have recently been demonstrated capable of localizing to lymph nodes that drain mucosal surfaces, in particular during T helper 2 (Th2) responses. Resistance of mice to infection with the gastrointestinal nematode Trichuris muris depends critically on mounting of a Th2 response and represents a useful model system to investigate Th2 responses. Following infection of resistant BALB\/c mice with T. muris, we observed accumulation of eosinophils in intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). The accumulation of MLN eosinophils was initiated during the second week of infection and peaked during worm expulsion. In contrast, we detected a comparably late and modest increase in eosinophil numbers in the MLNs of infected susceptible AKR mice. MLN eosinophils localized preferentially to the medullary region of the lymph node, displayed an activated phenotype and contributed to the interleukin-4 (IL-4) response in the MLN. Despite this, mice genetically deficient in eosinophils efficiently generated IL-4-expressing CD4(+) T cells, produced Th2 cytokines and mediated worm expulsion during primary T. muris infection. Thus, IL-4-expressing eosinophils accumulate in MLNs of T. muris-infected BALB\/c mice but are dispensable for worm expulsion and generation of Th2 responses, suggesting a distinct or subtle role of MLN eosinophils in the immune response to T. muris infection.","identifiers":{"nihms_id":"224028","pmid":"21155838","pmc_id":"3058490","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-3024.2010.01246.x"},"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-3024.2010.01246.x","stats":{"readers":4,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":75},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":25}],"country":[{"name":"Canada","value":25},{"name":"Australia","value":25},{"name":"Germany","value":25}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":75},{"name":"Post Doc","value":25}]},"issue":"1","pages":"1-11","publication_outlet":"Parasite Immunology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accumulation-eosinophils-intestinedraining-mesenteric-lymph-nodes-occurs-after-trichuris-muris-infection\/","uuid":"314d5e30-e1ad-11df-874c-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"M","surname":"Svensson"},{"forename":"L","surname":"Bell"},{"forename":"M C","surname":"Little"},{"forename":"M","surname":"DeSchoolmeester"},{"forename":"R M","surname":"Locksley"},{"forename":"K J","surname":"Else"}],"title":"Accumulation of eosinophils in intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes occurs after Trichuris muris infection.","volume":"33","year":2011,"categories":[43,331,47,38,47],"oa_journal":false},"f20819a0-6d07-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"We present a comprehensive study of the accuracy and dynamic range of spatial image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) and image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS).

sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.","tags":["dna sequencing","sequencing by synthesis","protein-dna interaction","illumina","genomics","chromosomes- human- x","consensus sequence","genome- human","genotype"],"website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2581791&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","pages":"53-59","public_file_hash":"2b1f3cef68624aeefc1de89bd55466717e8f4e88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accurate-whole-human-genome-sequencing-using-reversible-terminator-chemistry\/","volume":"456","categories":[411,342,8,193,194,326,462,80,82,25,455,387,89,28,331,210,30,34,35,101,311,380,43,40,41,44,225,52,300,35]},"b4b0ad90-ed92-11df-99a6-0024e8453de6":{"abstract":"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a vital role in initiating robust immunity against pathogens as well as maintaining immunological tolerance to self antigens.

In order to measure short-circuit current (Isc), transepithelial conductance (Gte) and area-related unidirectional fluxes of Na+ and Cl-, single split gill lamellae (epithelium plus cuticle) of hyperregulating shore crabs were mounted in a modified Ussing chamber. The negative short-circuit current measured with haemolymph-like NaCl saline on both sides of the epithelium could be inhibited by application of basolateral ouabain (ouabain inhibitor constant KOua=56±10 µmol l-1), 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB; KNPPB=7.5±2.5 mmol l-1) or Cs+ (10 mmol l-1). From the apical side, Isc was nearly completely blocked by Cs+ (10 mmol l-1) or Ba2+ (15 µmol l-1), whereas apical addition of furosemide (1 mmol l-1) resulted in only a small current decrease. Cl- influxes were linearly related to negative Isc. The ratio between net influxes of Cl- and Na+ was found to be approximately 2:1. With a single membrane preparation, achieved by permeabilizing the basolateral membrane with amphotericin B, Cl- influxes which were driven by a concentration gradient were shown to depend on the presence of apical Na+ and K+. On the basis of these observations, we propose that active and electrogenic absorption of NaCl across the gill epithelium of hyperregulating shore crabs proceeds as in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop in the mammalian nephron. Accordingly, branchial NaCl transport is mediated by apical K+ channels in cooperation with apical Na+\/K+\/2Cl- cotransporters and by the basolateral Na+\/K+-ATPase and basolateral Cl- channels.","keywords":["amphotericin b","carcinus maenas","crab","gill epithelium","ion fluxes","nacl absorption","short circuit current"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9319445","identifiers":{"pmid":"9319445","issn":"14779145"},"stats":{"readers":9,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":22},{"name":"Argentina","value":11},{"name":"Brazil","value":11}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":22},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":22},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":22}]},"issue":"Pt 7","pages":"1545-1554","public_file_hash":"9f8cd035b8f9b766c165320599bca00c3d31d6b5","publication_outlet":"Journal of Experimental Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/active-absorption-of-na-and-cl-across-the-gill-epithelium-of-the-shore-crab-carcinus-maenas-voltageclamp-and-ionflux-studies\/","uuid":"ced0bcc0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"S","surname":"Riestenpatt"},{"forename":"Horst","surname":"Onken"},{"forename":"D","surname":"Siebers"}],"title":"Active absorption of Na+ and Cl- across the gill epithelium of the shore crab Carcinus maenas: voltage-clamp and ion-flux studies","volume":"199","year":1996,"categories":[24,43],"groups":[{"profile_id":2999671,"date_added":1297800069000,"group_id":883371},{"profile_id":2634231,"date_added":1286563365000,"group_id":571461},{"profile_id":1021381,"date_added":1269448775000,"group_id":517881}],"oa_journal":false},"cfca10e0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Although aquatic animals are generally believed to export nitrogenous waste by diffusion of NH(3) or NH(4)(+) across external epithelia, evidence for active ammonia excretion has been found in a number of species. In the euryhaline green shore crab Carcinus maenas, active excretion of ammonia across isolated gills is reduced by inhibitors of the Na(+)\/K(+)-ATPase and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase. In addition, a functional dynamic microtubule network is necessary, since application of colchicine, taxol or thiabendazole leads to almost complete blockage of active and gradient-driven ammonia excretion.

Combined with an analysis of gill morphology, the strong intracellular but weak apical abundance of V-type H(+)-ATPase and the fact that ammonia flux rates are equal under buffered and unbuffered experimental conditions, our observations suggest a hypothetical model of transepithelial ammonia movement that features active uptake across the basolateral membrane, sequestration in acidified vesicles, vesicle transport via microtubules and exocytosis at the apical membrane.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12177142","identifiers":{"pmid":"12177142"},"stats":{"readers":8,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":25},{"name":"Canada","value":13},{"name":"Argentina","value":13}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":38},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":25},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":13}]},"issue":"Pt 18","pages":"2765-2775","publication_outlet":"Journal of Experimental Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/active-ammonia-excretion-across-the-gills-of-the-green-shore-crab-carcinus-maenas-participation-of-nakatpase-vtype-hatpase-and-functional-microtubules\/","publisher":"Co Biol","uuid":"cfca10e0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Dirk","surname":"Weihrauch"},{"forename":"Andreas","surname":"Ziegler"},{"forename":"Dietrich","surname":"Siebers"},{"forename":"David W","surname":"Towle"}],"title":"Active ammonia excretion across the gills of the green shore crab Carcinus maenas: participation of Na(+)\/K(+)-ATPase, V-type H(+)-ATPase and functional microtubules.","volume":"205","year":2002,"categories":[43,24,44,35,352,350],"groups":[{"profile_id":2634231,"date_added":1286563377000,"group_id":571461},{"profile_id":1021381,"date_added":1269448776000,"group_id":517881}],"oa_journal":false},"bd6ce210-a476-11df-9d6a-0024e8453de6":{"tags":["dna methylation"],"abstract":"DNA methylation is one of the best-characterized epigenetic modifications and has been implicated in numerous biological processes, including transposable element silencing, genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation.

In the past decade, many enzymes have been proposed to carry out active DNA demethylation and growing evidence suggests that, depending on the context, this process may be achieved by multiple mechanisms.

The precise location of the AIS varies across and within different neuronal types, and has been linked to cells' information-processing capabilities; however, the factors determining AIS position in individual neurons remain unknown. Here we show that changes in electrical activity can alter the location of the AIS. In dissociated hippocampal cultures, chronic depolarization with high extracellular potassium moves multiple components of the AIS, including voltage-gated sodium channels, up to 17 mum away from the soma of excitatory neurons. This movement reverses when neurons are returned to non-depolarized conditions, and depends on the activation of T- and\/or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The AIS also moved distally when we combined long-term LED (light-emitting diode) photostimulation with sparse neuronal expression of the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2; here, burst patterning of activity was successful where regular stimulation at the same frequency failed. Furthermore, changes in AIS position correlate with alterations in current thresholds for action potential spiking. Our results show that neurons can regulate the position of an entire subcellular structure according to their ongoing levels and patterns of electrical activity. This novel form of activity-dependent plasticity may fine-tune neuronal excitability during development.","website":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nature09160","identifiers":{"pmid":"20543823"},"stats":{"readers":83,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":78},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":12},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":24},{"name":"France","value":8},{"name":"Spain","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":36},{"name":"Post Doc","value":23},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":8}]},"issue":"7301","pages":"1070-1074","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/the-dbf4cdc7-kinase-promotes-s-phase-by-alleviating-an-inhibitory-activity-in-mcm4\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"9f580a30-6d07-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"Matthew S","surname":"Grubb"},{"forename":"Juan","surname":"Burrone"}],"title":"Activity-dependent relocation of the axon initial segment fine-tunes neuronal excitability.","volume":"465","year":2010,"categories":[103,101,43,108,434,462,334,455,335,385,176,331,30,90,35,352,350],"groups":[{"profile_id":3559821,"date_added":1296647168000,"group_id":834591},{"profile_id":1868201,"date_added":1295555049000,"group_id":812431},{"profile_id":24031,"date_added":1277378729000,"group_id":491791}],"oa_journal":false},"cf9ab7f0-6d0d-11df-936c-0026b95e484c":{"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether triploid salmonid fishes differ from diploids in their hematological and physiological responses to an acute handling and confinement stress, induced by netting fish from their tanks and placing them in a bucket.

Beginning about 50 years ago, physiological studies conducted with whole organisms or isolated tissues, by such pioneers of comparative thermal physiology as V.Ya. Alexandrov, T.H. Bullock, F.E.J. Fry, H. Precht, C.L. Prosser, and P.F. Scholander, began to document in detail the abilities of ectothermic animals to sustain relatively similar rates of metabolic activity at widely different temperatures of adaptation or acclimation. These studies naturally led to investigation of the roles played by enzymatic proteins in metabolic temperature compensation. Peter Hochachka's laboratory became an epicenter of this new focus in comparative physiology. The studies of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) that he initiated as a PhD student at Duke University in the mid-1960s and continued for several years at the University of British Columbia laid much of the foundation for subsequent studies of protein adaptation to temperature. Studies of orthologs of LDH have revealed the importance of conserving kinetic properties (catalytic rate constants (kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) and structural stability during adaptation to temperature, and recently have identified the types of amino acid substitutions causing this adaptive variation. The roles of pH and low-molecular-mass organic solutes (osmolytes) in conserving the functional and structural properties of enzymes also have been elucidated using LDH. These studies, begun in Peter Hochachka's laboratory almost 40 years ago, have been instrumental in the development of a conceptual framework for the study of biochemical adaptation, a field whose origin can be traced largely to his creative influences. This framework emphasizes the complementary roles of three \"strategies\" of adaptation: (1) changes in amino acid sequence that cause adaptive variation in the kinetic properties and stabilities of proteins, (2) shifts in concentrations of proteins, which are mediated through changes in gene expression and protein turnover; and (3) changes in the milieu in which proteins function, which conserve the intrinsic properties of proteins established by their primary structure and modulate protein activity in response to physiological needs. This theoretical framework has helped guide research in adaptational biochemistry for many years and now stands poised to play a critical role in the post-genomic era, as physiologists grapple with the challenge of integrating the wealth of new data on gene sequences (genome), gene expression (transcriptome and proteome), and metabolic profiles (metabolome) into a realistic physiological context that takes into account the evolutionary histories and environmental relationships of species.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15544958","identifiers":{"pmid":"15544958"},"stats":{"readers":24,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":92},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":4},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":13},{"name":"Portugal","value":4},{"name":"France","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":29},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":29},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":13}]},"issue":"3","pages":"321-333","publication_outlet":"Comparative biochemistry and physiology Part B Biochemistry molecular biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptation-of-enzymes-to-temperature-searching-for-basic-strategies\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"b9452bf0-6d00-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"George N","surname":"Somero"}],"title":"Adaptation of enzymes to temperature: searching for basic \"strategies\".","volume":"139","year":2004,"categories":[35,518,52,381,24,43,40,28,44,30,35,44],"groups":[{"profile_id":3924621,"date_added":1299063022000,"group_id":921951}],"oa_journal":false},"c7527190-6d04-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"The urgency for adaptation actions in response to climate risks is rapidly growing and climate change mitigation efforts alone are insufficient to avoid further, and often negative, impacts.

This requires well-structured, conceptual frameworks that connect science with action. These frameworks must also ensure that the scientific input into the adaptation process remains salient, credible and legitimate. For the field of agriculture and environmental sciences we review the urgency and the theoretical basis for such engagement processes.

strong trends in climate change already evident, the likelihood of further changes occurring, and the increasing scale of potential climate impacts give urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more coherently. There are many potential adaptation options available for marginal change of existing agricultural systems, often variations of existing climate risk management. We show that implementation of these options is likely to have substantial benefits under moderate climate change for some cropping systems. However, there are limits to their effectiveness under more severe climate changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource allocation need to be considered, such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods. We argue that achieving increased adaptation action will necessitate integration of climate change-related issues with other risk factors, such as climate variability and market risk, and with other policy domains, such as sustainable development. Dealing with the many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of scales and issues, for example, from the understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient markets that facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on integrated rather than disciplinary science and a strengthening of the interface with decision makers. A crucial component of this approach is the implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks that are relevant, robust, and easily operated by all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers, and scientists.","tags":["adaptation","agriculture"],"website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2148359&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","pages":"19691-19696","public_file_hash":"61e3da2d2507857d8405edde95eaf4c5fe82b301","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adapting-agriculture-to-climate-change-1\/","volume":"104","categories":[101,201,67,43,40,434,41,193,119,424,117,48,21,23,127,208,209,210,237]},"a28a77b0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"In an adaptive immune response, naive T cells proliferate during infection and generate long-lived memory cells that undergo secondary expansion after a repeat encounter with the same pathogen. Although natural killer (NK) cells have traditionally been classified as cells of the innate immune system, they share many similarities with cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We use a mouse model of cytomegalovirus infection to show that, like T cells, NK cells bearing the virus-specific Ly49H receptor proliferate 100-fold in the spleen and 1,000-fold in the liver after infection. After a contraction phase, Ly49H-positive NK cells reside in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs for several months. These self-renewing 'memory' NK cells rapidly degranulate and produce cytokines on reactivation. Adoptive transfer of these NK cells into naive animals followed by viral challenge results in a robust secondary expansion and protective immunity.

At a molecular level, the evolution of specialization is generally attributable to mutations that de-regulate the expression of existing biosynthetic and catabolic pathways. Trade-offs are associated with the evolution of resource specialization, but these trade-offs are often not the result of antagonistic pleiotropy.

Here we show that adaptation to climate change in a long-distance migrant is constrained by the timing of its migratory journey. For long-distance migrants climate change may advance the phenology of their breeding areas, but the timing of some species' spring migration relies on endogenous rhythms that are not affected by climate change. Thus, the spring migration of these species will not advance even though they need to arrive earlier on their breeding grounds to breed at the appropriate time. We show that the migratory pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca has advanced its laying date over the past 20 years. This temporal shift has been insufficient, however, as indicated by increased selection for earlier breeding over the same period. The shift is hampered by its spring arrival date, which has not advanced. Some of the numerous long-distance migrants will suffer from climate change, because either their migration strategy is unaffected by climate change, or the climate in breeding and wintering areas are changing at different speeds, preventing adequate adaptation.","tags":["climate in breeding and wintering areas are changi"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11357129","pages":"296-298","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adjustment-to-climate-change-is-constrained-by-arrival-date-in-a-longdistance-migrant-bird\/","volume":"411","categories":[119,35,201,39,36,203,23,52,43,46,210,352,423]},"e3418b90-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Although many reef fishes of the tropical Atlantic are widely distributed, there are large discontinuities that may strongly influence phylogeographical patterns. The freshwater outflow of the Amazon basin is recognized as a major barrier that produces a break between Brazilian and Caribbean faunas. The vast oceanic distances between Brazil and the mid-Atlantic ridge islands represent another formidable barrier. To assess the relative importance of these barriers, we compared a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b gene among populations of three species of Atlantic surgeonfishes: Acanthurus bahianus, A. chirurgus and A. coeruleus. These species have similar life histories but different adult habitat preferences. The mtDNA data show no population structure between Brazil and the mid-Atlantic islands, indicating that this oceanic barrier is readily traversed by the pelagic larval stage of all three surgeonfishes, which spend approximately 45-70 days in the pelagic environment. The Amazon is a strong barrier to dispersal of A. bahianus (d = 0.024, phiST = 0.724), a modest barrier for A. coeruleus (phiST = 0.356), and has no discernible effect as a barrier for A. chirurgus. The later species has been collected on soft bottoms with sponge habitats under the Amazon outflow, indicating that relaxed adult habitat requirements enable it to readily cross that barrier. A limited ability to use soft bottom habitats may also explain the low (but significant) population structure in A. coeruleus. In contrast, A. bahianus has not been collected over deep sponge bottoms, and rarely settles outside shallow reefs. Overall, adult habitat preferences seem to be the factor that differentiates phylogeographical patterns in these reef-associated species.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11856425","identifiers":{"pmid":"11856425"},"stats":{"readers":44,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":93},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":5},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":18},{"name":"Portugal","value":7},{"name":"Spain","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":36},{"name":"Post Doc","value":11},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":11}]},"issue":"2","pages":"243-252","publication_outlet":"Molecular Ecology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adult-habitat-preferences-larval-dispersal-and-the-comparative-phylogeography-of-three-atlantic-surgeonfishes-teleostei-acanthuridae-1\/","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","uuid":"e3418b90-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Luiz A","surname":"Rocha"},{"forename":"Anna L","surname":"Bass"},{"forename":"D Ross","surname":"Robertson"},{"forename":"Brian W","surname":"Bowen"}],"title":"Adult habitat preferences, larval dispersal, and the comparative phylogeography of three Atlantic surgeonfishes (Teleostei: Acanthuridae).","volume":"11","year":2002,"categories":[119,35,203,52,37,43,40,29,44,120,35,291,352,430],"oa_journal":false},"092ee810-6d04-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Recent landmark experiments have shown that transient overexpression of a small number of transcription factors can reprogram differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that resemble embryonic stem (ES) cells.

Although current iPS cell lines resemble ES cells, they have not passed the most stringent test of pluripotency by generating full-term or adult mice in tetraploid complementation assays, raising questions as to whether they are sufficiently potent to generate all of the cell types in an organism. Whether this difference between iPS and ES cells reflects intrinsic limitations of direct reprogramming is not known. Here we report fertile adult mice derived entirely from iPS cells that we generated by inducible genetic reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Producing adult mice derived entirely from a reprogrammed fibroblast shows that all features of a differentiated cell can be restored to an embryonic level of pluripotency without exposure to unknown ooplasmic factors. Comparing these fully pluripotent iPS cell lines to less developmentally potent lines may reveal molecular markers of different pluripotent states.

Hence, recombinant protein production is frequently the sole applicable procedure. The ribosomal machinery, located in the cytoplasm is an outstanding catalyst of recombinant protein biosynthesis. Escherichia coli facilitates protein expression by its relative simplicity, its inexpensive and fast high-density cultivation, the well-known genetics and the large number of compatible tools available for biotechnology. Especially the variety of available plasmids, recombinant fusion partners and mutant strains have advanced the possibilities with E. coli. Although often simple for soluble proteins, major obstacles are encountered in the expression of many heterologous proteins and proteins lacking relevant interaction partners in the E. coli cytoplasm. Here we review the current most important strategies for recombinant expression in E. coli. Issues addressed include expression systems in general, selection of host strain, mRNA stability, codon bias, inclusion body formation and prevention, fusion protein technology and site-specific proteolysis, compartment directed secretion and finally co-overexpression technology.

Utilising upon these constructs, we review six types of farming systems analysis and intervention that have evolved over the last 40 years, namely: (1) economic decision analysis based on production functions, (2) dynamic simulation of production processes, (3) economic decision analysis linked to biophysical simulation, (4) decision support systems, (5) expert systems, and (6) simulation-aided discussions about management in an action research paradigm. Biophysical simulation modelling features prominently in this list of approaches and considerable progress has been made in both the scope and predictive power of the modelling tools. We illustrate some more recent advances in increasing model comprehensiveness in simulating farm production systems via reference to our own group's work with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). Two case studies are discussed, one with broad-scale commercial agriculture in north-eastern Australia and the other with resource poor smallholder farmers in Africa. We conclude by considering future directions for systems analysis efforts directed at farming systems. We see the major challenges and opportunities lying at the interface of `hard', scientific approaches to the analysis of biophysical systems and `soft', approaches to intervention in social management systems.","keywords":["see front matter","01","0308 521x","2001 published elsevier","a","all rights reserved","apsim","au","b","brian","corresponding author","cse","csiro","decision support","dss","e mail address","farming systems","farmscape","keating","modelling","science ltd"],"website":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0308521X01000592","identifiers":{"issn":"0308521X","doi":"10.1016\/S0308-521X(01)00059-2"},"stats":{"readers":17,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":59},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":24},{"id":16,"name":"Management Science \/ Operations Research","value":6}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":18},{"name":"Ghana","value":6},{"name":"Colombia","value":6}],"status":[{"name":"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)","value":24},{"name":"Post Doc","value":18},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":18}]},"issue":"2-3","pages":"555-579","publication_outlet":"Agricultural Systems","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advances-farming-systems-analysis-intervention\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"8fbb3900-6d05-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"B A","surname":"Keating"},{"forename":"R L","surname":"Mccown"}],"title":"Advances in farming systems analysis and intervention","volume":"70","year":2001,"categories":[204,274,21,432,43,227,209,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":3515831,"date_added":1296327265000,"group_id":833631}],"oa_journal":false},"d2a78100-bf86-11df-833d-0024e8453de6":{"abstract":"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the liver, interface hepatitis (based on histologic examination), hypergammaglobulinemia, and production of autoantibodies. Many clinical and basic science studies have provided important insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of AIH. Transgenic mice that express human antigens and develop autoantibodies, liver-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells, liver inflammation, and fibrosis have been developed as models of AIH. AIH has been associated with autoantibodies against members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, transfer RNA selenocysteine synthase, formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase, and the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases, whereas alleles such as DRB10301 and DRB10401 are genetic risk factors in white North American and northern European populations. Deficiencies in the number and function of CD4(+)CD25(+) (regulatory) T cells disrupt immune homeostasis and might be corrected as a therapeutic strategy. Treatment can be improved by continuing corticosteroid therapy until normal liver test results and normal liver tissue are within normal limits, instituting ancillary therapies to prevent drug-related side effects, identifying problematic patients early, and providing long-term maintenance therapy after patients experience a first relapse. Calcineurin inhibitors and mycophenolate mofetil are potential salvage therapies, and reagents such as recombinant interleukin-10, abatacept, and CD3-specific antibodies are feasible as therapeutics. Liver transplantation is an effective salvage therapy, even in the elderly, and AIH must be considered in all patients with graft dysfunction after liver transplantation.

The AFLP technique is based on the selective PCR amplification of restriction fragments from a total digest of genomic DNA. The technique involves three steps: (i) restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification of sets of restriction fragments, and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification of restriction fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets of restriction fragments may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers of restriction fragments. The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system.

The responses represented an estimated 13,000-15,000 samples collected and processed per year. Kicknet devices were used in 64.5% of the methods; other sampling devices included fixed-area samplers (Surber and Hess), artificial substrates (Hester-Dendy and rock baskets), grabs, and dipnets. Regional differences existed, e.g., the 1-m kicknet was used more often in the eastern US than in the western US. Mesh sizes varied among programs but 80.2% of the methods used a mesh size between 500 and 600 mum. Mesh size variations within US Environmental Protection Agency regions were large, with size differences ranging from 100 to 700 mum. Most samples collected were composites; the mean area sampled was 1.7 m(2). Samples rarely were collected using a random method (4.7%); most samples (70.6%) were collected using \"expert opinion\", which may make data obtained operator-specific. Only 26.3% of the methods sorted all the organisms from a sample; the remainder subsampled in the laboratory. The most common method of subsampling was to remove 100 organisms (range = 100-550). The magnification used for sorting ranged from I (sorting by eye) to 30X, which results in inconsistent separation of macroinvertebrates from detritus. In addition to subsampling, 53% of the methods sorted large\/rare organisms from a sample. The taxonomic level used for identifying organisms varied among taxa; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera were generally identified to a finer taxonomic resolution (genus and species) than other taxa. Because there currently exists a large range of field and laboratory methods used by state programs, calibration among all programs to increase data comparability would be exceptionally challenging. However, because many techniques are shared among methods, limited testing could be designed to evaluate whether procedural differences affect the ability to determine levels of environmental impairment using benthic macroinvertebrate communities.","website":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/1468095?origin=crossref","identifiers":{"issn":"08873593","doi":"10.2307\/1468095"},"stats":{"readers":15,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":87},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":7},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":7}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":27},{"name":"Portugal","value":7},{"name":"","value":7}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":47},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":33},{"name":"Other Professional","value":7}]},"issue":"4","pages":"658-682","publication_outlet":"Journal of the North American Benthological Society","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/after-site-selection-before-data-analysis-sampling-sorting-laboratory-procedures-used-stream-benthic-macroinvertebrate-monitoring-programs-usa-state-agencies\/","publisher":"JSTOR","uuid":"ca9a25b0-6d08-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"J L","surname":"Carter"},{"forename":"V H","surname":"Resh"}],"title":"After site selection and before data analysis: sampling, sorting, and laboratory procedures used in stream benthic macroinvertebrate monitoring programs by USA state agencies","volume":"20","year":2001,"categories":[32,101,36,52,43,210],"oa_journal":false},"d68d1b00-6d05-11df-a474-0026b95e3e23":{"abstract":"Mushroom-forming fungi (Agaricomycetes, approx. syn.: Homobasidiomycetes) produce a diverse array of fruiting bodies, ranging from simple crust-like forms to complex, developmentally integrated forms, such as stinkhorns and veiled agarics. The 19th century Friesian system divided the mushroom-forming fungi according to macromorphology. The Friesian taxonomy has long been regarded as artificial, but it continues to influence the language of mycology and perceptions of fungal diversity. Throughout the 20th century, the phylogenetic significance of anatomical features was elucidated, and classifications that departed strongly from the Friesian system were proposed. However, the anatomical studies left many questions and controversies unresolved, due in part to the paucity of characters, as well as the general absence of explicit phylogenetic analyses. Problems in fruiting body evolution were among the first to be addressed when molecular characters became readily accessible in the late 1980s. Today, GenBank contains about 108,000 nucleotide sequences of 'homobasidiomycetes', filed under 7300 unique names. Analyses of these data are providing an increasingly detailed and robust view of the phylogeny and the distribution of different fruiting body forms across the 14 major clades that make up the agaricomycetes. However, it would be wrong to suggest that all the important questions about fruiting body evolution have been resolved. Recent studies focusing on resupinate forms suggest that there may still be undetected major clades of agaricomycetes, which could have a significant impact on our estimates of the ancestral forms in this morphologically diverse group. Modern approaches, including comparative phylogenetic analyses and developmental studies, have the potential to yield novel insights into both the macroevolutionary processes and cellular mechanisms of fungal morphological evolution.","identifiers":{"pmid":"17964768"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17964768","stats":{"readers":9,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":11},{"name":"Poland","value":11},{"name":"Brazil","value":11}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":22},{"name":"Other Professional","value":11},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":11}]},"issue":"Pt 9","pages":"1001-1018","publication_outlet":"Mycological Research","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/after-gold-rush-before-flood-evolutionary-morphology-mushroomforming-fungi-agaricomycetes-early-21st-century\/","uuid":"d68d1b00-6d05-11df-a474-0026b95e3e23","authors":[{"forename":"David S","surname":"Hibbett"}],"title":"After the gold rush, or before the flood?

In the present study we explored the energy expenditures of first-year (sub-adult) and older than one year (adult) Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) during torpor and their patterns of roost site selection and fat accumulation in an artificial roost site, removing from the equation the effects of differences in aerial foraging behaviour by feeding them on non-aerial prey (mealworms). Sub-adult bats had oxygen consumption during torpor that averaged 2.75 x greater than adult individuals. In an artificial enclosure in which bats could fly freely and choose whether to roost inside or outside of a hollow brick, sub-adults gained body mass at a significantly lower rate (67.8 mg x day(-1)) than adults (100.3 mg x day(-1)), despite being fed non-aerial prey (mealworms). The difference in rates of mass accumulation (32.5 mg per day) far exceeded the theoretical influence of different metabolic rates (7 mg x day(-1)) in torpor. Despite lower rates of mass gain in this artificial situation, sub-adults ultimately achieved the same mass accumulation as adults because they continued to accumulate fat for a longer period, an option that might be unavailable to them in the wild as feeding conditions deteriorate. The rate of body mass accumulation was positively correlated with the time spent utilising the brick roost site, but utilisation of this site did not differ significantly between age classes. These data support the hypothesis that differences in the accumulation of fat between age classes may reflect in part differences in expenditure as well as differences in food intake, but the contribution of differences in metabolism during torpor are relatively small.","keywords":["fat accumulation","hibernation torpor","myotis daubentonii","oxygen consumption"],"website":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.3161\/1733-5329%282006%298%5B509%3AARVITE%5D2.0.CO%3B2","identifiers":{"issn":"15081109","doi":"10.3161\/1733-5329(2006)8[509:ARVITE]2.0.CO;2"},"stats":{"readers":14,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":93},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":7}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":7},{"name":"United States","value":14},{"name":"Poland","value":14}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":29},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":21},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":14}]},"issue":"2","pages":"509-521","publication_outlet":"Acta Chiropterologica","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/age-related-variation-energy-costs-torpor-daubentons-bat-effects-fat-accumulation-prior-hibernation\/","publisher":"Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences","uuid":"f850c070-6d05-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"Tomasz","surname":"Kokurewicz"},{"forename":"John R","surname":"Speakman"}],"title":"Age related variation in the energy costs of torpor in Daubenton's bat: effects on fat accumulation prior to hibernation","volume":"8","year":2006,"categories":[201,52,24,43],"oa_journal":false},"f3379290-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"keywords":["age estimates","annuli","cichla","otoliths","reproduction","size structure","venezuela"],"identifiers":{"issn":"00221112","doi":"10.1111\/j.1095-8649.1999.tb00689.x"},"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1095-8649.1999.tb00689.x","stats":{"readers":12,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":83},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":17}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":8},{"name":"United States","value":17},{"name":"Canada","value":17}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":25},{"name":"Post Doc","value":25},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":17}]},"issue":"2","pages":"433-450","publication_outlet":"Journal of Fish Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/age-structure-and-growth-of-peacock-cichlids-from-rivers-and-reservoirs-of-venezuela\/","uuid":"f3379290-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"D B","surname":"Jepsen"},{"forename":"K O","surname":"Winemiller"},{"forename":"D C","surname":"Taphorn"},{"forename":"D","surname":"Rodriguez Olarte"}],"title":"Age structure and growth of peacock cichlids from rivers and reservoirs of Venezuela","volume":"55","year":1999,"categories":[201,37,43,208],"oa_journal":false},"83da3750-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Tillage generally reduces aggregation and particulate organic matter (POM) content. We hypothesized that reduced C sequestration in conventional tillage (CT) compared with no-tillage (NT) is related to differences in aggregate turnover. Four soils (Haplustoll, Fragiudalf, Hapludalf, and Paleudalf), each with NT, CT, and native vegetation (NV) treatments, were separated into aggregates. Free light fraction (LF) and intraaggregate POM (iPOM) were isolated. At one site we used C-13 natural abundance to differentiate crop- and grassland-derived C. Concentrations of coarse iPOM C (250-2000 mu m iPOM in macroaggregates), expressed on a per unit aggregate weight (g iPOM C kg(-1) aggregate), did not differ between tillage treatments. In contrast, concentrations of fine iPOM C (53-250 mu m iPOM in macroaggregates) were less in CT compared to NT macroaggregates, On a whole soil basis, fine iPOM C was on average 51% less in CT than in NT, and accounted for 21% of the total C difference between NT and CT. The concentration of free LF C was not affected by tillage, but was on average 45% less in the cultivated systems than NV. Proportions of crop-derived C in macroaggregates were similar in NT and CT, but were three times greater in microaggregates from NT than microaggregates from CT. We suggest that a faster turnover rate of macroaggregates in CT compared with NT leads to a slower rate of microaggregate formation within macroaggregates and less stabilization of new SOM in free microaggregates under CT.

One way is by reducing the overall intensity of competition via aggregated utilisation of fragmented resources. Known as the 'aggregation model of coexistence', this system assumes saturation and an equilibrium number of species per community. In this study we tested the effects of interspecific aggregation on the level of intraspecific aggregation among ectoparasites of marine fishes (36 communities of gill and head ectoparasite species). If parasite species are distributed in a way that interspecific aggregation is reduced relative to intraspecific aggregation then species coexistence is facilitated. We found a positive relationship between parasite species richness and fish body size, controlling for host phylogeny. A positive relationship between infracommunity species richness and total parasite species richness was also found, providing no evidence for saturation. This result supports the view that infracommunities of parasites are not saturated by local parasite residents. The observed lack of saturation implies that we are far from a full exploitation of the fish resource by parasites. Ectoparasites were aggregated at both population and species levels. However, only half of the ectoparasite communities were dominated by negative interspecific aggregation. We found that infracommunity parasite species richness was positively correlated with the level of intraspecific aggregation versus interspecific aggregation. This means that intraspecific aggregation increases compared with interspecific aggregation when total parasite species richness increases, controlling fish size and phylogeny. This supports one assumption of the 'aggregation model of coexistence', which predicts that interspecific interactions are reduced relative to intraspecific interactions, facilitating species coexistence.","website":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0020751999000296","identifiers":{"pmid":"10404260"},"stats":{"readers":29,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":90},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":10}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":17},{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"France","value":10}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":34},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":28},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":7}]},"issue":"5","pages":"663-672","publication_outlet":"International Journal for Parasitology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aggregation-and-species-coexistence-of-ectoparasites-of-marine-fishes\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"f383b6c0-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"S","surname":"Morand"},{"forename":"R","surname":"Poulin"},{"forename":"K","surname":"Rohde"},{"forename":"C","surname":"Hayward"}],"title":"Aggregation and species coexistence of ectoparasites of marine fishes.","volume":"29","year":1999,"categories":[35,201,203,37,455,43,40,47,352,47],"groups":[{"profile_id":3463681,"date_added":1305213628000,"group_id":1060211},{"profile_id":2185231,"date_added":1304087070000,"group_id":803361}],"oa_journal":false},"557ee630-6d08-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"tags":["changing agricultural practices","globalisation","livestock","wildlife"],"abstract":"With few exceptions, the diseases that present the greatest risk to food animal production have been largely similar throughout the modern era of veterinary medicine.

Global climate changes have already had profound effects on the distribution of animal diseases, and it is an inevitable reality that continually evolving climatic parameters will further transform the ecology of numerous pathogens.

The spread of novel strains of bluetongue virus across Europe is an ominous indicator that climate change is sure to influence trends in movement of agricultural diseases.

Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.","tags":["sustainable productivity"],"website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2610163&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","pages":"447-465","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agricultural-sustainability-concepts-principles-and-evidence\/","volume":"363","categories":[274,201,140,203,67,43,77,434,436,85,119,50,424,48,21,190,52,159,127,29,208,209,210,423,237,43]},"7ac431f0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["atrazine"],"abstract":"Global amphibian declines have often been attributed to disease, but ignorance of the relative importance and mode of action of potential drivers of infection has made it difficult to develop effective remediation. In a field study, here we show that the widely used herbicide, atrazine, was the best predictor (out of more than 240 plausible candidates) of the abundance of larval trematodes (parasitic flatworms) in the declining northern leopard frog Rana pipiens. The effects of atrazine were consistent across trematode taxa. The combination of atrazine and phosphate-principal agrochemicals in global corn and sorghum production-accounted for 74% of the variation in the abundance of these often debilitating larval trematodes (atrazine alone accounted for 51%). Analysis of field data supported a causal mechanism whereby both agrochemicals increase exposure and susceptibility to larval trematodes by augmenting snail intermediate hosts and suppressing amphibian immunity. A mesocosm experiment demonstrated that, relative to control tanks, atrazine tanks had immunosuppressed tadpoles, had significantly more attached algae and snails, and had tadpoles with elevated trematode loads, further supporting a causal relationship between atrazine and elevated trematode infections in amphibians. These results raise concerns about the role of atrazine and phosphate in amphibian declines, and illustrate the value of quantifying the relative importance of several possible drivers of disease risk while determining the mechanisms by which they facilitate disease emergence.","identifiers":{"pmid":"18972018"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18972018","stats":{"readers":30,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":77},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":20},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":33},{"name":"","value":3},{"name":"Spain","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":23},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":20},{"name":"Post Doc","value":13}]},"issue":"7217","pages":"1235-1239","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agrochemicals-increase-trematode-infections-in-a-declining-amphibian-species\/","uuid":"7ac431f0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Jason R","surname":"Rohr"},{"forename":"Anna M","surname":"Schotthoefer"},{"forename":"Thomas R","surname":"Raffel"},{"forename":"Hunter J","surname":"Carrick"},{"forename":"Neal","surname":"Halstead"},{"forename":"Jason T","surname":"Hoverman"},{"forename":"Catherine M","surname":"Johnson"},{"forename":"Lucinda B","surname":"Johnson"},{"forename":"Camilla","surname":"Lieske"},{"forename":"Marvin D","surname":"Piwoni"},{"forename":"Patrick K","surname":"Schoff"},{"forename":"Val R","surname":"Beasley"}],"title":"Agrochemicals increase trematode infections in a declining amphibian species.","volume":"455","year":2008,"categories":[207,201,36,37,52,454,43,40,46,29,47,210,38,352,350,47],"groups":[{"profile_id":3261471,"date_added":1296236904000,"group_id":825481},{"profile_id":28971,"date_added":1290197419000,"group_id":16112},{"profile_id":497661,"date_added":1264072914000,"group_id":95141}],"oa_journal":false},"be709ec0-6d05-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Agroecology involves various approaches to solve actual challenges of agricultural production. Though agroecology initially dealt primarily with crop production and protection aspects, in recent decades new dimensions such as environmental, social, economic, ethical and development issues are becoming relevant. Today, the term 'agroecology' means either a scientific discipline, agricultural practice, or political or social movement. Here we study the different meanings of agroecology. For that we analyse the historical development of agroecology. We present examples from USA, Brazil, Germany, and France. We study and discuss the evolution of different meanings agroecology. The use of the term agroecology can be traced back to the 1930s. Until the 1960s agroecology referred only as a purely scientific discipline. Then, different branches of agroecology developed. Following environmental movements in the 1960s that went against industrial agriculture, agroecology evolved and fostered agroecological movements in the 1990s. Agroecology as an agricultural practice emerged in the 1980s, and was often intertwined with movements. Further, the scales and dimensions of agroecological investigations changed over the past 80 years from the plot and field scales to the farm and agroecosystem scales. Actually three approaches persist: 1) investigations at plot and field scales, 2) investigations at the agroecosystem and farm scales, and 3) investigations covering the whole food system. These different approaches of agroecological science can be explained by the history of nations. In France, agroecology was mainly understood as a farming practice and to certain extent as a movement, whereas the corresponding scientific discipline was agronomy. In Germany, agroecology has a long tradition as a scientific discipline. In the USA and in Brazil all three interpretations of agroecology occur, albeit with a predominance of agroecology as a science in the USA and a stronger emphasis on movement and agricultural practice in Brazil. These varied meanings of the term agroecology cause confusion among scientists and the public, and we recommend that those who publish using this term be explicit in their interpretation.","identifiers":{"issn":"17740746","doi":"10.1051\/agro\/2009004"},"website":"http:\/\/www.agronomy-journal.org\/10.1051\/agro\/2009004","stats":{"readers":26,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":54},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":35},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":12}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":23},{"name":"United States","value":23},{"name":"Mexico","value":12}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":31},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":23},{"name":"Professor","value":12}]},"issue":"4","pages":"503-515","public_file_hash":"5d585d59ec9bf80be851751187e88b1d672cdadb","publication_outlet":"Agronomy for Sustainable Development","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/environmental-costs-and-benefits-of-transportation-biofuel-production-from-food-and-lignocellulosebased-energy-crops-a-review\/","uuid":"be709ec0-6d05-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"A","surname":"Wezel"},{"forename":"S","surname":"Bellon"},{"forename":"T","surname":"Dor\u00e9"},{"forename":"C","surname":"Francis"},{"forename":"D","surname":"Vallod"},{"forename":"C","surname":"David"}],"title":"Agroecology as a science, a movement and a practice.

Agroecology's credentials as a separate scientific discipline were measured against the norms of science, defined by Robert King Merton (1973): communalism, universality, disinterestedness, originality and doubt. It is concluded that agroecology meets many of these norms and where it differs, it does so in a way that perhaps anticipates the manner and the direction in which the social position of science is changing. Accepting agroecology as a separate scientific discipline, the two main issues with which it must contend were considered to be those of scaling and interdisciplinarity. Scaling is a problem because results of agroecological research are typically generated at small spatial scales whereas applications are frequently implemented in larger, administrative units. A framework to convey information from science to decision-makers was proposed and tested in a case study of farm energy use. Interdisciplinarity is a problem because researchers from different disciplines see the world from different viewpoints, use different language, work at different locations and use different criteria to evaluate one another's work. Progress in this area is likely to be slow and driven by the need to justify the value of science to society. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Pollinator activity at D. obtusifolius trees and subsequent seed production were recorded in three forest areas subject to differing intensities of S. siamensis extraction. The pollinator and plant understory communities in these areas were also noted. Forest areas subject to high S. siamensis extraction intensities had very high understory flowering plant cover, dominated by the exotic invader Chromolaena odorata. Activity of butterfly pollinators at D. obtusifolius trees decreased in these disturbed areas, although their abundance remained comparable to other forest areas subject to only moderate or no extraction. For sphingid moth pollinators, there was no difference across differentially disturbed forest areas in either abundance or in the proportion bearing pollen. Pollinator activity by birds increased at highly disturbed locations but was not sufficient to offset a decline in overall pollinator activity at D. obtusifolius canopies in areas of heavy S. siamensis extraction. Thus, extraction of S. siamensis indirectly affected the pollination of D. obtusifolius, primarily by causing changes in the foraging behavior of butterfly pollinators rather than their abundance. A shift in the relative abundance of floral nectar resources from the canopy to the understory a consequence of S. siamensis extraction and invasion by C odorata, led to a parallel shift in foraging location of the principal diurnal pollinators, the butterflies, toward the understory. Despite reduced pollination at disturbed sites, behavioral changes did not translate into a D. obtusifolius seed set effect, possibly because pollination by birds (or moths) at the disturbed site compensated for reduced butterfly pollination.","identifiers":{"issn":"00063606","doi":"10.1646\/Q1570"},"website":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/perlserv\/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1646%2FQ1570","stats":{"readers":45,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":82},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":13},{"id":9,"name":"Education","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":20},{"name":"Costa Rica","value":4},{"name":"Spain","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":27},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":16},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":11}]},"issue":"2","pages":"156-164","publication_outlet":"Biotropica","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alien-abduction-disruption-native-plantpollinator-interactions-invasive-species\/","uuid":"78b5b590-6d06-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"J","surname":"Ghazoul"}],"title":"Alien abduction: Disruption of native plant-pollinator interactions by invasive species","volume":"36","year":2004,"categories":[34,35,32,201,37,43,152,119,48,52,455,29,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":27624,"date_added":1284405033000,"group_id":440691},{"profile_id":2233301,"date_added":1282626590000,"group_id":408041},{"profile_id":2083361,"date_added":1282626590000,"group_id":544821}],"oa_journal":false},"5684e3b0-a55f-11df-a0b1-0024e8453de6":{"identifiers":{"issn":"10635157","doi":"10.1080\/10635150490445922"},"website":"http:\/\/sysbio.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1080\/10635150490445922","stats":{"readers":46,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":30},{"name":"France","value":4},{"name":"Canada","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":43},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":15},{"name":"Post Doc","value":13}]},"issue":"3","pages":"506-514","publication_outlet":"Systematic Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aligned-18s-insect-phylogeny-4\/","publisher":"Oxford University Press","uuid":"5684e3b0-a55f-11df-a0b1-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Karl","surname":"Kjer"}],"title":"Aligned 18S and Insect Phylogeny","volume":"53","year":2004,"categories":[35,32,39,23,52,43,40,41,46],"groups":[{"profile_id":2771101,"date_added":1288346369000,"group_id":624031},{"profile_id":4194,"date_added":1265712013000,"group_id":118851}],"oa_journal":false},"f2141510-0187-11e0-95f0-0024e8453de6":{"keywords":["dominance","feeding index","frequency occurrence","iai","methods","trophic ecology","weight"],"website":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1676-06032006000200013&lng=pt&nrm=iso&tlng=pt","identifiers":{"issn":"16760603","doi":"10.1590\/S1676-06032006000200013"},"stats":{"readers":20,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":90},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":10}],"country":[{"name":"Canada","value":5},{"name":"Brazil","value":70},{"name":"Norway","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":30},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":20},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":10}]},"issue":"2","pages":"1-8","publication_outlet":"Biota Neotropica","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alimentao-peixes-proposta-para-anlise-itens-registrados-em-contedos-gstricos-1\/","publisher":"SciELO Brasil","uuid":"f2141510-0187-11e0-95f0-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Sirlei Terezinha","surname":"Bennemann"},{"forename":"Lilian","surname":"Casatti"},{"forename":"Deise Cristiane De","surname":"Oliveira"}],"title":"Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de peixes: proposta para an\u00e1lise de itens registrados em conte\u00fados g\u00e1stricos","volume":"6","year":2006,"categories":[201,39,37,52,43,208],"oa_journal":false},"7e0f0540-6d02-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"Recent studies have revealed the contribution of TRIM5 to retrovirus restriction in cells from a variety of primate species. TRIM5 consists of a tripartite motif (the RBCC domain) followed by a B30.2 domain. The B30.2 domain is thought to be involved in determination of restriction specificity and contains three variable regions. To investigate the relationship between the phylogeny of primate TRIM5 and retrovirus restriction specificity, a series of chimeric TRIM5 consisting of the human RBCC domain followed by the B30.2 domain from various primates was constructed. These constructs showed restriction profiles largely consistent with the origin of the B30.2 domain. Restriction specificity was further investigated with a variety of TRIM5 s containing mixed or mutated B30.2 domains. This study revealed the importance of all three variable regions for determining restriction specificity. Based on the molecular structures of other PRYSPRY domains solved recently, a model for the molecular structure of the B30.2 domain of TRIM5 was developed. The model revealed that the variable regions of the B30.2 domain are present as loops located on one side of the B30.2 core structure. It is hypothesized that these three loops form a binding surface for virus and that evolutionary changes in any one of the loops can alter restriction specificity.","website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1563890&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:1563890","other":"0688-06","pmid":"16912305","pmc_id":"1563890","doi":"10.1128\/JVI.00688-06"},"stats":{"readers":6,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":83},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":17}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":50},{"name":"Canada","value":17},{"name":"United Kingdom","value":33}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":50},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":50}]},"issue":"17","pages":"8554-8565","publication_outlet":"Journal of Virology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/all-three-variable-regions-of-the-trim5alpha-b302-domain-can-contribute-to-the-specificity-of-retrovirus-restriction\/","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","uuid":"7e0f0540-6d02-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"Sadayuki","surname":"Ohkura"},{"forename":"Melvyn W","surname":"Yap"},{"forename":"Tom","surname":"Sheldon"},{"forename":"Jonathan P","surname":"Stoye"}],"title":"All three variable regions of the TRIM5alpha B30.2 domain can contribute to the specificity of retrovirus restriction.","volume":"80","year":2006,"categories":[51,43,331,51,35],"oa_journal":false},"075b19d0-6d01-11df-8e55-0026b95e43ca":{"abstract":"Expanding upon a preliminary communication (Nature 417 (2002) 166), we here further develop a multiple-causes model of allometry, where the exponent b is the sum of the influences of multiple contributors to control. The relative strength of each contributor, with its own characteristic value of bi, is determined by ci, the control contribution or control coefficient. A more realistic equation for the scaling of metabolism with body size thus can be written as BMR=MR0 ci(M\/M0)bi, where MR0 is the characteristic metabolic rate of an animal with a characteristic body mass, M0. With M0 of 1 unit mass (usually kg), MR0 takes the place of the value a, found in the standard scaling equation, bi is the scaling exponent of the process i, and ci is its control contribution to overall flux, or the control coefficient of the process i. One can think of this as an allometric cascade, with the b exponent for overall energy metabolism being determined by the bi and ci values for key steps in the complex pathways of energy demand and energy supply. Key intrinsic factors (such as neural and endocrine processes) or ecological extrinsic factors are considered to act through this system in affecting allometric scaling of energy turnover. Applying this model to maximum vs. BMR data for the first time explains the differing scaling behaviour of these two biological states in mammals, both in the absence and presence of intrinsic regulators such as thyroid hormones (for BMR) and catecholamines (for maximum metabolic rate).","keywords":["1","allometry","biologists have known since","body mass","body size","control analysis","follow allometric","metabolic rates organisms","metabolic regulation","rather than isometric","relationship with","scaling","late 1800s"],"website":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1095643302003641","identifiers":{"issn":"10956433","doi":"10.1016\/S1095-6433(02)00364-1"},"stats":{"readers":13,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":85},{"id":24,"name":"Sports and Recreation","value":8},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":8}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":8},{"name":"United States","value":15},{"name":"Canada","value":8}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":31},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":31},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":15}]},"issue":"4","pages":"675-691","publication_outlet":"Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A Molecular Integrative Physiology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/allometric-cascade-model-resolving-body-mass-effects-metabolism-1\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"075b19d0-6d01-11df-8e55-0026b95e43ca","authors":[{"forename":"Peter W","surname":"Hochachka"}],"title":"Allometric cascade: a model for resolving body mass effects on metabolism","volume":"134","year":2003,"categories":[24,43,27,331,448],"oa_journal":false},"ac7fc0e0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Cooperation and social support are the major advantages of living in social groups. However, there are also disadvantages arising from social conflict and competition. Social conflicts may increase allostatic load, which is reflected in increased concentrations of glucocorticoids. We applied the emerging concept of allostasis to investigate the relation between social status and glucocorticoid concentrations. Animals in a society experience different levels of allostatic load and these differences may predict relative glucocorticoid concentrations of dominant and subordinate individuals. We reviewed the available data from free-ranging animals and generated, for each sex separately, phylogenetic independent contrasts of allostatic load and relative glucocorticoid concentrations. Our results suggest that the relative allostatic load of social status predicts whether dominants or subordinates express higher or lower concentrations of glucocorticoids. There was a significant correlation between allostatic load of dominance and relative glucocorticoid concentrations in both females and males. When allostatic load was higher in dominants than in subordinates, dominants expressed higher levels of glucocorticoids; when allostatic load was similar in dominants and subordinates, there were only minor differences in glucocorticoid concentrations; and when allostatic load was lower in dominants than in subordinates, subordinates expressed higher levels of glucocorticoids than dominants. To our knowledge, this is the first model that consistently explains rank differences in glucocorticoid concentrations of different species and sexes. The heuristic concept of allostasis thus provides a testable framework for future studies of how social status is reflected in glucocorticoid concentrations.","website":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S000334720300441X","identifiers":{"issn":"00033472","doi":"10.1016\/j.anbehav.2003.08.007"},"stats":{"readers":32,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":84},{"id":22,"name":"Psychology","value":9},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":34},{"name":"France","value":6},{"name":"Portugal","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":34},{"name":"Post Doc","value":28},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":9}]},"issue":"3","pages":"591-602","publication_outlet":"Animal Behaviour","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/allostatic-load-social-status-and-stress-hormones-the-costs-of-social-status-matter\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"ac7fc0e0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Wolfgang","surname":"Goymann"}],"title":"Allostatic load, social status and stress hormones: the costs of social status matter","volume":"67","year":2004,"categories":[411,428,23,52,364,24,43],"groups":[{"profile_id":604081,"date_added":1265403483000,"group_id":557091}],"oa_journal":false},"f4ae5ea0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Forty years ago, a simple model of allosteric mechanisms (indirect interactions between distinct sites), used initially to explain feedback-inhibited enzymes, was presented by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux.

In both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems. Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure of ecosystems.

This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area.

Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86% with a minor isoform frequency of 15% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.","tags":["rna-seq","splicing"],"keywords":["alternative splicing","alternative splicing genetics","base sequence","cell line","exons","exons genetics","gene expression profiling","humans","open reading frames","open reading frames genetics","organ specificity","polyadenylation","protein isoforms","protein isoforms genetics","repressor proteins","repressor proteins metabolism","rna","messenger","messenger analysis","messenger genetics","rna binding proteins","rna binding proteins metabolism"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18978772","pages":"470-6","public_file_hash":"6a6ca7fb6c0cbd93279796936971e60f38877b34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alternative-isoform-regulation-human-tissue-transcriptomes\/","volume":"456","categories":[35,341,101,38,43,44,51,462,352,80,188,334,25,455,385,27,89,300,331,28,90,303,30]},"ada04c10-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"In this paper, an alternative method is presented to convert computed tomography (CT)-scans into 3D biomodels.

Athree times larger fraction of the shoot was allocated to flowers in alpine plants (30 species, 2700 m asl) compared to lowland plants (20 species, 600 m asl), while leaf mass fraction did not differ between the altitudes. At high elevation, a three times smaller fraction of the shoot was allocated to stems, which was accompanied by a change in its function from leaf support for photosynthesis at low altitude to support for flowers at high altitude. Although shoot mass is massively reduced at high altitudes, display area and biomass of individual flowers were remarkably similar at both altitudes. All flowers together attracted pollinators with about the same total display area relative to overall plants size, but generally alpine plants maintain their flowers longer. Together with decreased plant height this leads to an increased self-shading which is likely to cause reductions in carbon gain in alpine plants.

Location Field work was carried out on the eastern slope of the eastern Cordillera, Colombian Andes, between Tama Peak to the north, in the Tama National Park (07 degrees 23' N, 72 degrees 23' W) and the San Miguel River (00 degrees 28' N, 77 degrees 17' W) to the south. Methods Sampling was carried out between February 1997 and November 1999 in five regions spanning elevation gradients. In each gradient, six sites were chosen at 250 m intervals between 1000 and 2250 m a.s.l. Results We found a curvilinear relationship between altitude and mean species richness, with a peak in richness at middle elevations. However, the diversity of dung beetle assemblages does not seem to be related to the interregional differences in environmental conditions. The number of geographically restricted species is negatively and significantly related to altitude, with geographically restricted species more frequent at low altitude sites. Ordination delimited the two main groups according to altitude: one with all the highest sites (1750-2250 m a.s.l.) and a second group with the remaining sites 1750 m a.s.l.). Analysis of species co-occurrence shows that these dung beetle assemblages seem to be spatially structured when all sites have the same probability of being chosen. In contrast, the spatial structure of species assemblages seems to be random when the probability of choosing any site is proportional to its altitude. Main conclusions The altitude of sites is the main factor that influences the diversity of these dung beetle assemblages. The peak in species richness at middle elevations, the higher number of geographically restricted species at lower altitudinal levels, and the compositional differences along these mountain gradients seem to result from the mixing at these altitudes of dung beetle assemblages that have different environmental adaptations and, probably, different origins. The relevance of altitude in these assemblages is related to the limited role of these Neotropical high altitude environments as centres of refuge and vicariance for a monophyletic group of warm-adapted species, for which the vertical colonization of these high mountain environments by lineages distributed at lower altitudes would have been very difficult.","keywords":["altitudinal distribution","colombian andes","composition","correspondence","diversity","dung beetles","federico escobar","scarabaeinae","species co occurrence"],"website":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1466-822X.2005.00161.x\/full","identifiers":{"issn":"1466822X","doi":"10.1111\/j.1466-822x.2005.00161.x"},"stats":{"readers":36,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":89},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":11}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":11},{"name":"Mexico","value":6},{"name":"Canada","value":6}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":25},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":17},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":14}]},"issue":"4","pages":"327-337","publication_outlet":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altitudinal-variation-of-dung-beetle-scarabaeidae-scarabaeinae-assemblages-in-the-colombian-andes\/","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","uuid":"e4322d20-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Federico","surname":"Escobar"},{"forename":"Jorge M","surname":"Lobo"},{"forename":"Gonzalo","surname":"Halffter"}],"title":"Altitudinal variation of dung beetle ( Scarabaeidae : Scarabaeinae ) assemblages in the Colombian Andes","volume":"14","year":2005,"categories":[32,48,201,52,43,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":5912,"date_added":1264388883000,"group_id":526691}],"oa_journal":false},"e2b7e930-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2292225","other":"20071087","pmid":"18362170","pmc_id":"2292225","doi":"10.1084\/jem.20071087"},"stats":{"readers":40,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":80},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":18},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":18},{"name":"Portugal","value":5},{"name":"Ghana","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":20},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":18},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15}]},"issue":"4","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","uuid":"e2b7e930-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Mirjam","surname":"Kool"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Soulli\u00e9"},{"forename":"Menno","surname":"Van Nimwegen"},{"forename":"Monique A M","surname":"Willart"},{"forename":"Femke","surname":"Muskens"},{"forename":"Steffen","surname":"Jung"},{"forename":"Henk C","surname":"Hoogsteden"},{"forename":"Hamida","surname":"Hammad"},{"forename":"Bart N","surname":"Lambrecht"}],"title":"Alum adjuvant boosts adaptive immunity by inducing uric acid and activating inflammatory dendritic cells.","year":2008,"groups":[{"profile_id":2559151,"date_added":1286411449000,"group_id":566161},{"profile_id":24843,"date_added":1285771984000,"group_id":470231},{"profile_id":715061,"date_added":1281115164000,"group_id":384471},{"profile_id":2114681,"date_added":1281091161000,"group_id":369891}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"Alum (aluminum hydroxide) is the most widely used adjuvant in human vaccines, but the mechanism of its adjuvanticity remains unknown.

However, very little is known about their physiology or their contribution to nitrification. Here we report oligotrophic ammonia oxidation kinetics and cellular characteristics of the mesophilic crenarchaeon 'Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus' strain SCM1. Unlike characterized ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, SCM1 is adapted to life under extreme nutrient limitation, sustaining high specific oxidation rates at ammonium concentrations found in open oceans. Its half-saturation constant (K(m) = 133 nM total ammonium) and substrate threshold (390 Myr of insect evolution requires insight into their origin. Molecular clocks are widely applied for evolutionary dating, but clocks for the class Insecta have remained elusive. We now define a robust nucleotide and amino acid mitochondrial molecular clock encompassing five insect orders, including the Blattaria (cockroaches), Orthoptera (crickets and locusts), Hemiptera (true bugs), Diptera, and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Calibration of the clock using one of the earliest, most extensive fossil records for insects (the early ancestors of extant Blattaria) was congruent with all available insect fossils, with biogeographic history, with the Cambrian explosion, and with independent dating estimates from Lepidopteran families. In addition, dates obtained from both nucleotide and amino acid clocks were congruent with each other. Of particular interest to vector biology is the early date of the emergence of triatomine bugs (99.8-93.5 MYA), coincident with the formation of the South American continent during the breakup of Gondwanaland. More generally, we reveal the insects arising from a common ancestor with the Anostraca (fairy shrimps) at around the Silurian-Ordovician boundary (434.2-421.1 MYA) coinciding with the earliest plant megafossil.

Many of the papers present evidence of microevolution occurring over contemporary time frames, further validating the near ubiquity of ongoing evolution in the world around us. Several synthetic reviews of empirical work help to define the conditions under which microevolution is or is not likely to occur. Some of the studies speak directly to current controversies in evolutionary biology, such as the relative roles of determinism and contingency, and the nature of the relationship between microevolution and macroevolution. In general, microevolution seems driven largely by deterministic mechanisms, particularly natural selection, but contingency plays a role in (1) determining whether or not suitable conditions are present for evolution to proceed, and (2) guiding the precise manner by which evolution proceeds. Several theoretical treatments and empirical reviews confirm previous research in showing that microevolutionary processes are at least capable of generating macroevolutionary trends. Macroevolution may indeed reflect microevolution writ large but the pattern by which it arises is perhaps best characterized as microevolution writ in fits and starts.","tags":["microevolution"],"keywords":["adaptation","adaptive radiation","contingency","determinism","evolutionary rates","macroevolution","microevolution","natural selection","speciation"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11838760","pages":"1-8","public_file_hash":"603dd8ffc3187c8333fc6ef3368bdf85f292990c","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/an-introduction-to-microevolution-rate-pattern-process-1\/","volume":"112-113","categories":[35,32,201,37,43,40,46,44,225,23,52,26,210]},"01756b10-fef1-11df-95f0-0024e8453de6":{"stats":{"readers":10,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":40},{"name":"Canada","value":10},{"name":"Brazil","value":10}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":50},{"name":"Post Doc","value":20},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":10}]},"issue":"April","pages":"1-14","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/introduction-picante-package-installing-picante-data-formats-picante\/","uuid":"01756b10-fef1-11df-95f0-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Steven","surname":"Kembel"}],"title":"An introduction to the picante package Installing picante Data formats in picante","year":2010,"categories":[37,52,455,43,40,41,29,45],"groups":[{"profile_id":2776761,"date_added":1291929168000,"group_id":616401}],"oa_journal":false},"bf6751d0-8361-11df-aedb-0024e8453de8":{"abstract":"The worldwide obesity epidemic is stimulating efforts to identify host and environmental factors that affect energy balance.

Here we demonstrate through metagenomic and biochemical analyses that these changes affect the metabolic potential of the mouse gut microbiota. Our results indicate that the obese microbiome has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the diet. Furthermore, this trait is transmissible: colonization of germ-free mice with an 'obese microbiota' results in a significantly greater increase in total body fat than colonization with a 'lean microbiota'. These results identify the gut microbiota as an additional contributing factor to the pathophysiology of obesity.","keywords":["animals","bacteria","bacteria classification","bacteria genetics","bacteria isolation & purification","bacteria metabolism","cecum","cecum metabolism","cecum microbiology","energy metabolism","genome","bacterial","bacterial genetics","mice","inbred c57bl","obese","obesity","obesity metabolism","obesity microbiology","sequence analysis","dna","thinness","thinness microbiology"],"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17183312","identifiers":{"pmid":"17183312","issn":"14764687","doi":"10.1038\/nature05414"},"stats":{"readers":85,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":81},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":11},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":36},{"name":"Portugal","value":4},{"name":"Ghana","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Post Doc","value":13},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":11}]},"issue":"7122","pages":"1027-31","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/obesityassociated-gut-microbiome-increased-capacity-energy-harvest-12\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"bf6751d0-8361-11df-aedb-0024e8453de8","authors":[{"forename":"Peter J","surname":"Turnbaugh"},{"forename":"Ruth E","surname":"Ley"},{"forename":"Michael A","surname":"Mahowald"},{"forename":"Vincent","surname":"Magrini"},{"forename":"Elaine R","surname":"Mardis"},{"forename":"Jeffrey I","surname":"Gordon"}],"title":"An obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest.","volume":"444","year":2006,"categories":[35,101,201,38,336,43,41,44,187,49,116,21,322,355,52,455,385,27,28,331,30,329],"groups":[{"profile_id":3299611,"date_added":1301166035000,"group_id":952341},{"profile_id":3368781,"date_added":1295256001000,"group_id":782171},{"profile_id":31729,"date_added":1286740513000,"group_id":573861},{"profile_id":535391,"date_added":1282418642000,"group_id":405521},{"profile_id":95262,"date_added":1275885716000,"group_id":16872},{"profile_id":272072,"date_added":1265285516000,"group_id":113001}],"oa_journal":false},"b1691a40-6d0a-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"Arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungi are obligate endosymbionts that colonize the roots of almost 80% of land plants. This paper describes the employment of a combined morphological and molecular approach to demonstrate that the cytoplasm of the arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita harbors a further bacterial endosymbiont. Intracytoplasmic bacterium-like organisms (BLOs) were detected ultrastructurally in its spores and germinating and symbiotic mycelia. Morphological observations with a fluorescent stain revealed about 250,000 live bacteria inside each spore. The sequence for the small-subunit rRNA gene obtained for the BLOs from the spores was compared with those for representatives of the eubacterial lineages. Molecular phylogenetic analysis unambiguously showed that the endosymbiont of G. margarita was an rRNA group II pseudomanad (genus Burkholderia). PCR assays with specifically designed oligonucleotides were used to check that the sequence came from the BLOs. Successful amplification was obtained when templates from both the spores and the symbiotic mycelia were used. A band of the expected length was also obtained from spores of a Scutellospora sp. No bands were given by the negative controls. These findings indicate that mycorrhizal systems can include plant, fungal, and bacterial cells.","website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=168087&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:168087","pmid":"8702293","pmc_id":"168087"},"stats":{"readers":11,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":91},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":9}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":9},{"name":"United States","value":45},{"name":"Portugal","value":9}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":27},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":18},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":9}]},"issue":"8","pages":"3005-3010","publication_outlet":"Applied and Environmental Microbiology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/obligately-endosymbiotic-mycorrhizal-fungus-itself-harbors-obligately-intracellular-bacteria\/","publisher":"Am Soc Microbiol","uuid":"b1691a40-6d0a-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"V","surname":"Bianciotto"},{"forename":"C","surname":"Bandi"},{"forename":"D","surname":"Minerdi"},{"forename":"M","surname":"Sironi"},{"forename":"H V","surname":"Tichy"},{"forename":"P","surname":"Bonfante"}],"title":"An obligately endosymbiotic mycorrhizal fungus itself harbors obligately intracellular bacteria.","volume":"62","year":1996,"categories":[49,48,201,43,41,35],"oa_journal":false},"cd5a4960-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Recent cladistic analyses are revealing the phylogeny of flowering plants in increasing detail, and there is support for the monophyly of many major groups above the family level.

Many recent studies have yielded increasingly detailed evidence for the positions of formerly unplaced families, resulting in a number of newly adopted orders, including Amborellales, Berberidopsidales, Bruniales, Buxales, Chloranthales, Escalloniales, Huerteales, Nymphaeales, Paracryphiales, Petrosaviales, Picramniales, Trochodendrales, Vitales and Zygophylla- les. A number of previously unplaced genera and families are included here in orders, greatly reducing the number of unplaced taxa; these include Hydatellaceae (Nymphaeales), Haptanthaceae (Buxales), Peridiscaceae (Saxifragales), Huaceae (Oxalidales), Centroplacaceae and Rafflesiaceae (both Malpighiales), Aphloiaceae, Geisso- lomataceae and Strasburgeriaceae (all Crossosomatales), Picramniaceae (Picramniales), Dipentodontaceae and Gerrardinaceae (both Huerteales), Cytinaceae (Malvales), Balanophoraceae (Santalales), Mitrastemonaceae (Ericales) and Boraginaceae (now at least known to be a member of lamiid clade). Newly segregated families for genera previously understood to be in other APG-recognized families include Petermanniaceae (Liliales), Calophyllaceae (Malpighiales), Capparaceae and Cleomaceae (both Brassicales), Schoepfiaceae (Santalales), Anacampserotaceae, Limeaceae, Lophiocarpaceae, Montiaceae and Talinaceae (all Caryophyllales) and Linder- niaceae and Thomandersiaceae (both Lamiales). Use of bracketed families is abandoned because of its unpopu- larity, and in most cases the broader circumscriptions are retained; these include Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceace and Xanthorrheaceae (all Asparagales), Passifloraceae (Malpighiales), Primulaceae (Ericales) and several other smaller families. Separate papers in this same volume deal with a new linear order for APG, subfamilial names that can be used for more accurate communication in Amaryllidaceae s.l., Asparagaceace s.l. and Xanthorrheaceae s.l. (all Asparagales) and a formal supraordinal classification for the flowering plants.","website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x","identifiers":{"issn":"00244074","doi":"10.1111\/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x"},"stats":{"readers":147,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":90},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":7},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":1}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":7},{"name":"Iran","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":29},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":20},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":10}]},"issue":"2","pages":"105-121","public_file_hash":"53113cc9b54774f15d969b8ea41585dbc4b1b8c1","publication_outlet":"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/update-angiosperm-phylogeny-group-classification-orders-families-flowering-plants-apg-iii\/","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","uuid":"71f8e9d0-6d00-11df-8e55-0026b95e43ca","authors":[{"forename":"Mark W","surname":"Chase"},{"forename":"Michael F","surname":"Fay"},{"forename":"James L","surname":"Reveal"},{"forename":"Douglas E","surname":"Soltis"},{"forename":"Pamela S","surname":"Soltis"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"F"},{"forename":"Arne A","surname":"Anderberg"},{"forename":"Michael J","surname":"Moore"},{"forename":"Richard G","surname":"Olmstead"},{"forename":"Paula J","surname":"Rudall"},{"forename":"Kenneth","surname":"J"}],"title":"An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III","volume":"161","year":2009,"categories":[35,201,39,203,43,46,44,119,48,21,52,249,25,455,385,26,29,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":5031581,"date_added":1306523945000,"group_id":1152631},{"profile_id":470071,"date_added":1304695175000,"group_id":188911},{"profile_id":4412421,"date_added":1303313899000,"group_id":1007911},{"profile_id":2017171,"date_added":1299163791000,"group_id":926511},{"profile_id":2822031,"date_added":1291841294000,"group_id":723541},{"profile_id":1067711,"date_added":1283532081000,"group_id":425391}],"oa_journal":false},"5c0e8aa0-d87e-11df-82d0-0024e8453de6":{"keywords":["bioavailability","cancer","cardiovascular","carotenoids","lycopene","lycopenoids"],"identifiers":{"issn":"19411413","doi":"10.1146\/annurev.food.102308.124120"},"website":"http:\/\/arjournals.annualreviews.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1146\/annurev.food.102308.124120","stats":{"readers":5,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":60},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":40}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":60},{"name":"Brazil","value":20},{"name":"China","value":20}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":60},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":20},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":20}]},"issue":"1","pages":"189-210","publication_outlet":"Annual Review of Food Science and Technology new in 2010","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/update-health-effects-tomato-lycopene\/","uuid":"5c0e8aa0-d87e-11df-82d0-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Erica N","surname":"Story"},{"forename":"Rachel E","surname":"Kopec"},{"forename":"Steven J","surname":"Schwartz"},{"forename":"G Keith","surname":"Harris"}],"title":"An Update on the Health Effects of Tomato Lycopene","volume":"1","year":2010,"categories":[33,80],"oa_journal":false},"60cbd450-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Pork meat and processed pork products have been the sources of outbreaks of listeriosis in France and in other European countries during the last decade. The aim of this review is to understand how contamination, survival and growth of Listeria monocytogenes can occur in pork meat products. This study discusses the presence of L. monocytogenes in raw pork meat, in the processing environment and in finished products. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes generally increases from the farm to the manufacturing plants and this mainly due to cross-contamination. In many cases, this pathogen is present in raw pork meat at low or moderate levels, but foods involved in listeriosis outbreaks are those in which the organism has multiplied to reach levels significantly higher than 1000 CFU g(-1). In such cases, L. monocytogenes has been able to survive and\/or to grow despite the hurdles encountered during the manufacturing and conservation processes. Accordingly, attention must be paid to the design of food-processing equipment and to the effectiveness of the cleaning and disinfecting procedures in factories. Finally, the production of safe pork meat products is based on the implementation of general preventive measures such as Good Hygiene Practices, Good Manufacturing and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point.","identifiers":{"pmid":"16834586"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16834586","stats":{"readers":12,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":83},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":8},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":8}],"country":[{"name":"Greece","value":25},{"name":"Belgium","value":8},{"name":"Spain","value":25}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":50},{"name":"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)","value":25},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":8}]},"issue":"1","pages":"7-17","publication_outlet":"Journal of Applied Microbiology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/an-updated-review-of-listeria-monocytogenes-in-the-pork-meat-industry-and-its-products\/","uuid":"60cbd450-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"D","surname":"Th\u00e9venot"},{"forename":"A","surname":"Dernburg"},{"forename":"C","surname":"Vernozy-Rozand"}],"title":"An updated review of Listeria monocytogenes in the pork meat industry and its products.","volume":"101","year":2006,"categories":[33,21,80,43,210,41],"groups":[{"profile_id":698441,"date_added":1283419907000,"group_id":422361}],"oa_journal":false},"afb0d200-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["review"],"abstract":"The potential of microalgae as a source of biofuels and as a technological solution for CO2 fixation is subject to intense academic and industrial research. In the perspective of setting up massive cultures, the management of large quantities of residual biomass and the high amounts of fertilizers must be considered. Anaerobic digestion is a key process that can solve this waste issue as well as the economical and energetic balance of such a promising technology. Indeed, the conversion of algal biomass after lipid extraction into methane is a process that can recover more energy than the energy from the cell lipids. Three main bottlenecks are identified to digest microalgae. First, the biodegradability of microalgae can be low depending on both the biochemical composition and the nature of the cell wall. Then, the high cellular protein content results in ammonia release which can lead to potential toxicity. Finally, the presence of sodium for marine species can also affect the digester performance. Physico-chemical pretreatment, co-digestion, or control of gross composition are strategies that can significantly and efficiently increase the conversion yield of the algal organic matter into methane. When the cell lipid content does not exceed 40%, anaerobic digestion of the whole biomass appears to be the optimal strategy on an energy balance basis, for the energetic recovery of cell biomass. Lastly, the ability of these CO2 consuming microalgae to purify biogas and concentrate methane is discussed.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19289163","identifiers":{"pmid":"19289163"},"stats":{"readers":48,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":56},{"id":11,"name":"Engineering","value":25},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":13}],"country":[{"name":"United Arab Emirates","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":13},{"name":"Portugal","value":8}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":46},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":17},{"name":"Post Doc","value":8}]},"issue":"4","pages":"409-416","publication_outlet":"Biotechnology Advances","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anaerobic-digestion-of-microalgae-as-a-necessary-step-to-make-microalgal-biodiesel-sustainable\/","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","uuid":"afb0d200-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Bruno","surname":"Sialve"},{"forename":"Nicolas","surname":"Bernet"},{"forename":"Olivier","surname":"Bernard"}],"title":"Anaerobic digestion of microalgae as a necessary step to make microalgal biodiesel sustainable.","volume":"27","year":2009,"categories":[204,202,43,40,41,193,73,192,187,223,48,190,188,27,29,28,210,90,30,211],"groups":[{"profile_id":2772451,"date_added":1302334024000,"group_id":1004141},{"profile_id":855811,"date_added":1299610070000,"group_id":939101},{"profile_id":1178361,"date_added":1277217461000,"group_id":292961},{"profile_id":431871,"date_added":1270075483000,"group_id":519691}],"oa_journal":false},"3a547040-95d1-11df-96dc-0024e8453de8":{"abstract":"To assess the effects of premedication with buprenorphine on the characteristics of anaesthesia induced with ketamine\/medetomidine.","identifiers":{"pmid":"20230555"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20230555","stats":{"readers":3,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":33},{"name":"Austria","value":33},{"name":"China","value":33}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":33},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":33},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":33}]},"issue":"3","pages":"222-229","publication_outlet":"Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anaesthesia-combination-ketamine-medetomidine-rabbit-effect-premedication-buprenorphine-4\/","uuid":"3a547040-95d1-11df-96dc-0024e8453de8","authors":[{"forename":"Kathy L","surname":"Murphy"},{"forename":"Johnny V","surname":"Roughan"},{"forename":"Mark G","surname":"Baxter"},{"forename":"Paul A","surname":"Flecknell"}],"title":"Anaesthesia with a combination of ketamine and medetomidine in the rabbit: effect of premedication with buprenorphine.","volume":"37","year":2010,"categories":[50,350],"oa_journal":false},"4d7bfb50-6d01-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"This article discusses analgesia and chemical restraint for the emergency patient.

Quarter milk samples for bacteriological culture were routinely collected at 3-wk intervals from all lactating animals (n = 95 5). Additional samples were collected at calving, clinical mastitis, dry-off, and culling. During the 78-wk observation period, 54 Strep. uberis infections were observed. The majority of infections occurred during a 21-wk period that constituted the disease outbreak. The incidence rate was higher in quarters that had recovered from prior Strep. uberis infection than in quarters that had not experienced Strep. uberis infection before. The incidence rate of Strep. uberis infection did not differ between quarters that were infected with other pathogens compared with quarters that were not infected with other pathogens. The expected number of new Strep. uberis infections per 3-wk interval was described by means of a Poisson logistic regression model. Significant predictor variables in the model were the number of existing Strep. uberis infections in the preceding time interval (shedders), phase of the study (early phase vs. postoutbreak phase), and prior infection status of quarters with respect to Strep. uberis, but not infection status with respect to other pathogens.

We also directly estimated a human intergeneration mutation rate of approximately 1.1 x 10(-8) per position per haploid genome. Both offspring in this family have two recessive disorders: Miller syndrome, for which the gene was concurrently identified, and primary ciliary dyskinesia, for which causative genes have been previously identified. Family-based genome analysis enabled us to narrow the candidate genes for both of these Mendelian disorders to only four.

We undertook an assessment of LD in sugarcane (Saccharum spp), characterized by one of the most complex crop genomes, with its high ploidy level (>or=8) and chromosome number (>100) as well as its interspecific origin. Using AFLP markers, we surveyed 1,537 polymorphisms among 72 modern sugarcane cultivars. We exploited information from available genetic maps to determine a relevant statistical threshold that discriminates marker associations due to linkage from other associations. LD is very common among closely linked markers and steadily decreases within a 0-30 cM window. Many instances of linked markers cannot be recognized due to the confounding effect of polyploidy. However, LD within a sample of cultivars appears as efficient as linkage analysis within a controlled progeny in terms of assigning markers to cosegregation groups. Saturating the genome coverage remains a challenge, but applying LD-based mapping within breeding programs will considerably speed up the localization of genes controlling important traits by making use of phenotypic information produced in the course of selection.","identifiers":{"pmid":"18196216"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18196216","stats":{"readers":19,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":95},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":5},{"name":"United States","value":5},{"name":"Malaysia","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":16},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":11}]},"issue":"5","pages":"701-714","publication_outlet":"Tag Theoretical And Applied Genetics Theoretische Und Angewandte Genetik","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-of-genomewide-linkage-disequilibrium-in-the-highly-polyploid-sugarcane\/","uuid":"15153330-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Louis-Marie","surname":"Raboin"},{"forename":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","surname":"Pauquet"},{"forename":"Mike","surname":"Butterfield"},{"forename":"Ang\u00e9lique","surname":"D'Hont"},{"forename":"Jean-Christophe","surname":"Glaszmann"}],"title":"Analysis of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium in the highly polyploid sugarcane.","volume":"116","year":2008,"categories":[35,48,21,43,28,210,44,35],"groups":[{"profile_id":10149,"date_added":1302960554000,"group_id":1045641},{"profile_id":31007,"date_added":1282671369000,"group_id":410311},{"profile_id":81282,"date_added":1281420062000,"group_id":388321},{"profile_id":31007,"date_added":1266968958000,"group_id":137951},{"profile_id":31007,"date_added":1264528162000,"group_id":102041},{"profile_id":9348,"date_added":1241572323000,"group_id":1096}],"oa_journal":false},"46a5a130-6d08-11df-936c-0026b95e484c":{"abstract":"The vertebrate Hox genes have been shown to be important for patterning the primary and secondary axes of the developing vertebrate embryo. The function of these genes along the primary axis of the embryo has been generally interpreted in the context of positional specification and homeotic transformation of axial structures. The way in which these genes are expressed and function during the development of the secondary axes, particularly the limb, is less clear. In order to provide a reference for understanding the role of the Hox genes in limb patterning, we isolated clones of 23 Hox genes expressed during limb development, characterized their expression patterns and analyzed their regulation by the signalling centers which pattern the limb. The expression patterns of the Abd-B-related Hoxa and Hoxd genes have previously been partially characterized; however, our study reveals that these genes are expressed in patterns more dynamic and complex than generally appreciated, only transiently approximating simple, concentric, nested domains. Detailed analysis of these patterns suggests that the expression of each of the Hoxa and Hoxd genes is regulated in up to three independent phases. Each of these phases appears to be associated with the specification and patterning of one of the proximodistal segments of the limb (upper arm, lower arm and hand). Interestingly, in the last of these phases, the expression of the Hoxd genes violates the general rule of spatial and temporal colinearity of Hox gene expression with gene order along the chromosome. In contrast to the Abd-B-related Hoxa and Hoxd genes, which are expressed in both the fore and hind limbs, different sets of Hoxc genes are expressed in the two limbs. There is a correlation between the relative position of these genes along the chromosome and the axial level of the limb bud in which they are expressed. The more 3' genes are expressed in the fore limb bud while the 5' genes are expressed in the hind limb bud; intermediate genes are transcribed in both limbs. However, there is no clear correlation between the relative position of the genes along the chromosome and their expression domains within the limb. With the exception of Hoxc-11, which is transcribed in a posterior portion of the hind limb, Hoxc gene expression is restricted to the anterior\/proximal portion of the limb bud. Importantly, comparison of the distributions of Hoxc-6 RNA and protein products reveals posttranscriptional regulation of this gene, suggesting that caution must be exercised in interpreting the functional significance of the RNA distribution of any of the vertebrate Hox genes. To understand the genesis of the complex patterns of Hox gene expression in the limb bud, we examined the propagation of Hox gene expression relative to cell proliferation. We find that shifts in Hox gene expression cannot be attributed to passive expansion due to cell proliferation. Rather, phase-specific Hox gene expression patterns appear to result from a context-dependent response of the limb mesoderm to Sonic hedgehog. Sonic hedgehog (the patterning signal from the Zone of Polarizing Activity) is known to be able to activate Hoxd gene expression in the limb. Although we find that Sonic hedgehog is capable of initiating and polarizing Hoxd gene expression during both of the latter two phases of Hox gene expression, the specific patterns induced are not determined by the signal, but depend upon the temporal context of the mesoderm receiving the signal. Misexpression of Sonic hedgehog also reveals that Hoxb-9, which is normally excluded from the posterior mesenchyme of the leg, is negatively regulated by Sonic hedgehog and that Hoxc-11, which is expressed in the posterior portion of the leg, is not affected by Sonic hedgehog and hence is not required to pattern the skeletal elements of the lower leg.","identifiers":{"pmid":"8625833"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8625833","stats":{"readers":24,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":83},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":8},{"id":22,"name":"Psychology","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":4},{"name":"United States","value":21},{"name":"Slovakia","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":25},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":17},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":13}]},"issue":"5","pages":"1449-1466","publication_outlet":"Development Cambridge England","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-hox-gene-expression-chick-limb-bud\/","uuid":"46a5a130-6d08-11df-936c-0026b95e484c","authors":[{"forename":"C E","surname":"Nelson"},{"forename":"B A","surname":"Morgan"},{"forename":"A C","surname":"Burke"},{"forename":"E","surname":"Laufer"},{"forename":"E","surname":"DiMambro"},{"forename":"L C","surname":"Murtaugh"},{"forename":"E","surname":"Gonzales"},{"forename":"L","surname":"Tessarollo"},{"forename":"L F","surname":"Parada"},{"forename":"C","surname":"Tabin"}],"title":"Analysis of Hox gene expression in the chick limb bud.","volume":"122","year":1996,"categories":[411,35,23,43,385,31,121,30,31],"groups":[{"profile_id":902571,"date_added":1295419256000,"group_id":806501},{"profile_id":2497861,"date_added":1285329401000,"group_id":460991},{"profile_id":23105,"date_added":1248040776000,"group_id":3312}],"oa_journal":false},"e3652080-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:1205020","other":"1312479","pmid":"1644282","pmc_id":"1205020"},"stats":{"readers":207,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":96},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":1},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":1}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":27},{"name":"Portugal","value":5},{"name":"","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Post Doc","value":21},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":13}]},"issue":"2","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Genetics","publisher":"Genetics Soc America","uuid":"e3652080-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"L","surname":"Excoffier"},{"forename":"P E","surname":"Smouse"},{"forename":"J M","surname":"Quattro"}],"title":"Analysis of Molecular Variance Inferred from Metric Distances among DNA Haplotypes: Application to Human Mitochondrial DNA Restriction Data","year":1992,"groups":[{"profile_id":3541571,"date_added":1304547108000,"group_id":946041},{"profile_id":2488481,"date_added":1299246159000,"group_id":891651},{"profile_id":3349581,"date_added":1294316607000,"group_id":773121},{"profile_id":133912,"date_added":1285701006000,"group_id":510641},{"profile_id":8879,"date_added":1.2609974e+12,"group_id":68371}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as -statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and -statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.","tags":["679","amova"],"website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1205020&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","pages":"479-491","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-of-molecular-variance-inferred-from-metric-distances-among-dna-haplotypes-application-to-human-mitochondrial-dna-restriction-data\/","volume":"131","categories":[34,411,35,32,38,201,37,43,312,40,41,46,44,424,48,21,52,455,26,29,331,28,210,35]},"9c32e750-6d05-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"identifiers":{"pmid":"11846609"},"stats":{"readers":453,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":83},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":12},{"id":11,"name":"Engineering","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":22},{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"","value":0}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":41},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":10}]},"issue":"4","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Methods San Diego Calif","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"9c32e750-6d05-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"K J","surname":"Livak"},{"forename":"T D","surname":"Schmittgen"}],"title":"Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) Method.","year":2001,"groups":[{"profile_id":2379361,"date_added":1303907435000,"group_id":1071571},{"profile_id":376791,"date_added":1303262644000,"group_id":470571},{"profile_id":3614681,"date_added":1301241751000,"group_id":845361},{"profile_id":1003071,"date_added":1299522708000,"group_id":733371},{"profile_id":1742231,"date_added":1296260204000,"group_id":835721},{"profile_id":70142,"date_added":1294119195000,"group_id":478421},{"profile_id":1733941,"date_added":1292869397000,"group_id":749091},{"profile_id":890891,"date_added":1291530353000,"group_id":215831},{"profile_id":2752801,"date_added":1289548895000,"group_id":610781},{"profile_id":2721671,"date_added":1289401594000,"group_id":600231},{"profile_id":1514511,"date_added":1284678912000,"group_id":445611},{"profile_id":461581,"date_added":1283776478000,"group_id":170021},{"profile_id":2228231,"date_added":1282741212000,"group_id":400611},{"profile_id":405471,"date_added":1282047945000,"group_id":398661},{"profile_id":2083461,"date_added":1282047375000,"group_id":398651},{"profile_id":2039731,"date_added":1281959614000,"group_id":366311},{"profile_id":2139391,"date_added":1280937707000,"group_id":380241},{"profile_id":1862621,"date_added":1279225731000,"group_id":324141},{"profile_id":1865431,"date_added":1277117083000,"group_id":319021},{"profile_id":952801,"date_added":1274363937000,"group_id":170251},{"profile_id":1462721,"date_added":1273069221000,"group_id":244601},{"profile_id":1389151,"date_added":1272370201000,"group_id":355991},{"profile_id":876821,"date_added":1270630648000,"group_id":159801},{"profile_id":33505,"date_added":1270487178000,"group_id":197551},{"profile_id":952801,"date_added":1269866587000,"group_id":174921},{"profile_id":859391,"date_added":1269348002000,"group_id":179211},{"profile_id":461581,"date_added":1263402448000,"group_id":84571}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"The two most commonly used methods to analyze data from real-time, quantitative PCR experiments are absolute quantification and relative quantification.

Because fluorescence correlation spectroscopy is restricted to rapidly diffusing particles and CP to slower processes, these two methods complement each other. For the analysis of binding-related contributions to mobility we have derived analytical expressions for the temporal behavior of CP curves from which the bound fraction and\/or the dissociation rate or residence time at binding sites, respectively, can be obtained. In experiments, we investigated HeLa cells expressing different fluorescent proteins: Although enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) shows high mobility, fusions of histone H2B with the yellow fluorescent protein are incorporated into chromatin, and these nuclei exhibit the presence of a stably bound and a freely diffusing species. Nonpermanent binding was found for mTTF-I, a transcription termination factor for RNA polymerase I, fused with EGFP. The cells show fluorescent nucleoli, and binding is transient. CP yields residence times for mTTF-I-EGFP of approximately 13 s.","website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1302895&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:1302895","other":"15222","pmid":"12719264","pmc_id":"1302895"},"stats":{"readers":11,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":73},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":18},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":9}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":18},{"name":"France","value":27},{"name":"United States","value":18}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":27},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":18},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":18}]},"issue":"5","pages":"3353-3363","publication_outlet":"Biophysical Journal","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analyzing-intracellular-binding-and-diffusion-with-continuous-fluorescence-photobleaching\/","publisher":"Biophysical Society","uuid":"e7fb4970-6d0a-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Malte","surname":"Wachsmuth"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Weidemann"},{"forename":"Gabriele","surname":"M\u00fcller"},{"forename":"Urs W","surname":"Hoffmann-Rohrer"},{"forename":"Tobias A","surname":"Knoch"},{"forename":"Waldemar","surname":"Waldeck"},{"forename":"J\u00f6rg","surname":"Langowski"}],"title":"Analyzing Intracellular Binding and Diffusion with Continuous Fluorescence Photobleaching","volume":"84","year":2003,"categories":[455,42,43,385,27,331,80],"oa_journal":false},"65364fd0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"New methods for parsimony analysis of large data sets are presented.

Furthermore, the model assumes that BMR and Vo2max are causally linked, and therefore, evolutionary changes in their levels cannot occur independently. To test this, we compared metabolic and anatomical correlates of selection for high and low body mass-corrected BMR in males of laboratory mice of F18 and F19 selected generations. Divergent selection resulted in between-line difference in BMR equivalent to 2.3 phenotypic standard deviation units. Vo2max elicited by forced swimming in 20 degrees C water was higher in the low BMR than high BMR line and did not differ between the lines when elicited by exposure to heliox at -2.5 degrees C. Moreover, the magnitude of swim- and heliox-induced hypothermia was significantly smaller in low BMR mice, whereas their interscapular brown adipose tissue was larger than in high BMR mice. Our results are therefore at variance with the predictions of aerobic capacity model. The selection also resulted in correlated response in food consumption (C) and masses of metabolically active internal organs: kidneys, liver, small intestine, and heart, which fuel maximum, sustained metabolic rate (SusMR) rather than Vo2max. These correlated responses were strong enough to claim the existence of positive, genetic correlations between BMR and the mass of viscera as well as C. Thus, our findings support the suggestion that BMR evolved as a correlated response to selection for SusMR, not Vo2max. In functional terms BMR should therefore be interpreted as a measure of energetic costs of maintenance of metabolic machinery necessary to sustain high levels of energy assimilation rate.","identifiers":{"pmid":"15674764"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15674764","stats":{"readers":5,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"Brazil","value":40},{"name":"Poland","value":20},{"name":"South Africa","value":20}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":40},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":20},{"name":"Post Doc","value":20}]},"issue":"6","pages":"890-899","publication_outlet":"Physiological and biochemical zoology PBZ","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anatomic-and-energetic-correlates-of-divergent-selection-for-basal-metabolic-rate-in-laboratory-mice\/","uuid":"e9502c10-6cff-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"Aneta","surname":"Ksiazek"},{"forename":"Marek","surname":"Konarzewski"},{"forename":"Iwona B","surname":"Lapo"}],"title":"Anatomic and energetic correlates of divergent selection for basal metabolic rate in laboratory mice.","volume":"77","year":2004,"categories":[43,24,35,352],"oa_journal":false},"7ac255d0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anatomy of the brachial plexus, sciatic, and femoral nerves for the use of a peripheral nerve-stimulator to perform nerve blocks in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective experimental trial. ANIMALS: Four canine cadavers and four healthy adult dogs weighing 23 2.5 kg. METHODS: Phase I: in four canine cadavers, an anatomical study was conducted to evaluate accurate needle-insertion techniques. Phase II: the utility of these techniques, and the value of electrostimulation, were evaluated in four anesthetized dogs in lateral recumbency (medetomidine, 5 microg kg(-1)\/ketamine 5 mg kg(-1)) using an electrical stimulator and shielded needles. RESULTS: For the brachial plexus, the needle was inserted cranial to the acromion, medial to the subscapularis muscle, at an angle of approximately 20-30 degrees in relation to a plane vertical to the surface on which the animal was lying, oriented parallel to the long axis of the animal, in a ventro-caudal direction. For the sciatic nerve, the needle was inserted just cranial to the sacrotuberous ligament, through the gluteus superficialis muscle, at an angle of approximately 60 degrees in relation to the horizontal plane, in a ventro-cranial direction, and up to the level of the ischium. For the femoral nerve, the needle was inserted perpendicular to the skin, just cranial to the femoral artery, and directed a little caudally. Using a peripheral nerve-stimulator, all nerves were located, and muscle contractions were elicited at a current of 0.2-0.4 mA. No complications were observed during the procedures. CONCLUSION: Electrostimulation of peripheral nerves is useful in locating the branches of the brachial plexus as well as the sciatic and femoral nerves in dogs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Peripheral nerve stimulation increases the reliability of a nerve block when compared with blind needle-insertion.","identifiers":{"pmid":"17696969"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17696969","stats":{"readers":6,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":83},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":17}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":17},{"name":"United States","value":17},{"name":"United Kingdom","value":33}],"status":[{"name":"Other Professional","value":33},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":33},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":17}]},"issue":"1","pages":"80-89","publication_outlet":"Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anatomical-and-experimental-studies-of-brachial-plexus-sciatic-and-femoral-nervelocation-using-peripheral-nerve-stimulation-in-the-dog\/","uuid":"7ac255d0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Stephan P","surname":"Mahler"},{"forename":"Andrew O","surname":"Adogwa"}],"title":"Anatomical and experimental studies of brachial plexus, sciatic, and femoral nerve-location using peripheral nerve stimulation in the dog.","volume":"35","year":2008,"categories":[50,331,357,352],"oa_journal":false},"045fe5c0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:1489191","pmid":"16805647","pmc_id":"1489191","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pbio.0040235"},"stats":{"readers":21,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":95},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":33},{"name":"Panama","value":10},{"name":"Argentina","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":38},{"name":"Post Doc","value":14},{"name":"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)","value":10}]},"issue":"8","editors":[{"forename":"Laurent","surname":"Keller"}],"type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"PLoS Biology","publisher":"Public Library of Science","uuid":"045fe5c0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Nicole M","surname":"Gerardo"},{"forename":"Sarah R","surname":"Jacobs"},{"forename":"Cameron R","surname":"Currie"},{"forename":"Ulrich G","surname":"Mueller"}],"title":"Ancient Host\u2013Pathogen Associations Maintained by Specificity of Chemotaxis and Antibiosis","year":2006,"groups":[{"profile_id":21397,"date_added":1.2830212e+12,"group_id":415661},{"profile_id":21397,"date_added":1282939162000,"group_id":414541}],"oa_journal":true,"abstract":"Switching by parasites to novel hosts has profound effects on ecological and evolutionary disease dynamics. Switching requires that parasites are able to establish contact with novel hosts and to overcome host defenses. For most hostparasite associations, it is unclear as to what specific mechanisms prevent infection of novel hosts. Here, we show that parasitic fungal species in the genus Escovopsis, which attack and consume the fungi cultivated by fungus-growing ants, are attracted to their hosts via chemotaxis. This response is host-specific: Escovopsis spp. grow towards their natural host cultivars more rapidly than towards other closely related fungi. Moreover, the cultivated fungi secrete compounds that can suppress Escovopsis growth. These antibiotic defenses are likewise specific: in most interactions, cultivars can inhibit growth of Escovopsis spp. not known to infect them in nature but cannot inhibit isolates of their naturally infecting pathogens . Cases in which cultivars are susceptible to novel Escovopsis are limited to a narrow set of hostparasite strain combinations. Targeted chemotactic and antibiotic responses therefore explain why Escovopsis pathogens do not readily switch to novel hosts, consequently constraining long-term dynamics of hostparasite coevolution within this ancient association.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16805647","pages":"e235","public_file_hash":"1b0d59e7c9b7029f45a6faab233da0bd6657ba7b","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ancient-hostpathogen-associations-maintained-by-specificity-of-chemotaxis-and-antibiosis\/","volume":"4","categories":[32,81,23,455,43,40,41,45,35,41]},"d22bbcb0-6d05-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"pmid":"20148029"},"stats":{"readers":131,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":82},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":3},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":18},{"name":"","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":26},{"name":"Post Doc","value":16},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":11}]},"issue":"7282","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Nature","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"d22bbcb0-6d05-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Morten","surname":"Rasmussen"},{"forename":"Yingrui","surname":"Li"},{"forename":"Stinus","surname":"Lindgreen"},{"forename":"Jakob Skou","surname":"Pedersen"},{"forename":"Anders","surname":"Albrechtsen"},{"forename":"Ida","surname":"Moltke"},{"forename":"Mait","surname":"Metspalu"},{"forename":"Ene","surname":"Metspalu"},{"forename":"Toomas","surname":"Kivisild"},{"forename":"Ramneek","surname":"Gupta"},{"forename":"Marcelo","surname":"Bertalan"},{"forename":"Kasper","surname":"Nielsen"},{"forename":"M Thomas P","surname":"Gilbert"},{"forename":"Yong","surname":"Wang"},{"forename":"Maanasa","surname":"Raghavan"},{"forename":"Paula F","surname":"Campos"},{"forename":"Hanne Munkholm","surname":"Kamp"},{"forename":"Andrew S","surname":"Wilson"},{"forename":"Andrew","surname":"Gledhill"},{"forename":"Silvana","surname":"Tridico"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Bunce"},{"forename":"Eline D","surname":"Lorenzen"},{"forename":"Jonas","surname":"Binladen"},{"forename":"Xiaosen","surname":"Guo"},{"forename":"Jing","surname":"Zhao"},{"forename":"Xiuqing","surname":"Zhang"},{"forename":"Hao","surname":"Zhang"},{"forename":"Zhuo","surname":"Li"},{"forename":"Minfeng","surname":"Chen"},{"forename":"Ludovic","surname":"Orlando"},{"forename":"Karsten","surname":"Kristiansen"},{"forename":"Mads","surname":"Bak"},{"forename":"Niels","surname":"Tommerup"},{"forename":"Christian","surname":"Bendixen"},{"forename":"Tracey L","surname":"Pierre"},{"forename":"Bjarne","surname":"Gr\u00f8nnow"},{"forename":"Morten","surname":"Meldgaard"},{"forename":"Claus","surname":"Andreasen"},{"forename":"Sardana A","surname":"Fedorova"},{"forename":"Ludmila P","surname":"Osipova"},{"forename":"Thomas F G","surname":"Higham"},{"forename":"Christopher Bronk","surname":"Ramsey"},{"forename":"Thomas V O","surname":"Hansen"},{"forename":"Finn C","surname":"Nielsen"},{"forename":"Michael H","surname":"Crawford"},{"forename":"S\u00f8ren","surname":"Brunak"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Sicheritz-Pont\u00e9n"},{"forename":"Richard","surname":"Villems"},{"forename":"Rasmus","surname":"Nielsen"},{"forename":"Anders","surname":"Krogh"},{"forename":"Jun","surname":"Wang"},{"forename":"Eske","surname":"Willerslev"}],"title":"Ancient human genome sequence of an extinct Palaeo-Eskimo.","year":2010,"groups":[{"profile_id":2517261,"date_added":1297269481000,"group_id":862641},{"profile_id":2517261,"date_added":1297166129000,"group_id":862671},{"profile_id":486151,"date_added":1289901517000,"group_id":90071},{"profile_id":2198081,"date_added":1281707287000,"group_id":394541},{"profile_id":16450,"date_added":1280362849000,"group_id":371871},{"profile_id":1401681,"date_added":1273055657000,"group_id":245131},{"profile_id":13561,"date_added":1265895462000,"group_id":96831}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"We report here the genome sequence of an ancient human.

Two predictions emerge from a comparison of resource pulses in the literature: (1) the bottom-up effects of resource pulses should transmit through aquatic food webs faster because of differences in the growth rates, life history, and stoichiometry of organisms in aquatic vs. terrestrial systems, and (2) the impacts of resource pulses should also persist longer in terrestrial systems because of longer generation times, the long-lived nature of many terrestrial resource pulses, and reduced top-down effects of consumers in terrestrial systems compared to aquatic systems. To examine these predictions, we use a case study of a resource pulse that affects both terrestrial and aquatic systems: the synchronous emergence of periodical cicadas (Magicicada spp.) in eastern North American forests. In general, studies that have examined the effects of periodical cicadas on terrestrial and aquatic systems support the prediction that resource pulses transmit more rapidly in aquatic systems; however, support for the prediction that resource pulse effects persist longer in terrestrial systems is equivocal. We conclude that there is a need to elucidate the indirect effects and long-term implications of resource pulses in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.","keywords":["allochthonous subsidies","bottom up top down effects","ecosystem retention","magicicada","periodical cicadas","resource pulses","spp","terrestrial aquatic food","transient effects","webs"],"website":"http:\/\/www.esajournals.org\/doi\/full\/10.1890\/07-0303.1","identifiers":{"issn":"00129658"},"stats":{"readers":28,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":71},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":25},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":11},{"name":"United States","value":32},{"name":"Mexico","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":39},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":18},{"name":"Post Doc","value":14}]},"issue":"3","pages":"647-659","publication_outlet":"America","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparing-resource-pulses-in-aquatic-and-terrestrial-ecosystems\/","publisher":"Eco Soc America","uuid":"6a25a840-c1ad-11df-833d-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Aquatic","surname":"Station"},{"forename":"San","surname":"Marcos"},{"forename":"Santa","surname":"Barbara"}],"title":"AND TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS","volume":"89","year":2008,"categories":[119,201,36,52,37,43,29,209],"groups":[{"profile_id":2722131,"date_added":1295534290000,"group_id":652911},{"profile_id":856881,"date_added":1294362520000,"group_id":347211}],"oa_journal":false},"37939d20-6d01-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"Anesthesia, sedation, and pain management should be taken seriously in the emergency patient.

However, interpretation of the complex transcriptional changes that occur during stress still poses many challenges because the relationship between changes at the transcriptional level and other levels of biological organisation is not well understood. To confront these challenges, a conceptual model linking physiological and transcriptional responses to stress would be helpful. Here, we provide the basis for one such model by synthesising data from organismal, endocrine, cellular, molecular, and genomic studies. We show using available examples from ectothermic vertebrates that reduced oxygen levels and oxidative stress are common to many stress conditions and that the responses to different types of stress, such as environmental, handling and confinement stress, often converge at the challenge of dealing with oxygen imbalance and oxidative stress. As a result, a common set of stress responses exists that is largely independent of the type of stressor applied. These common responses include the repair of DNA and protein damage, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, changes in cellular metabolism that reflect the transition from a state of cellular growth to one of cellular repair, the release of stress hormones, changes in mitochondrial densities and properties, changes in oxygen transport capacities and changes in cardio-respiratory function. Changes at the transcriptional level recapitulate these common responses, with many stress-responsive genes functioning in cell cycle control, regulation of transcription, protein turnover, metabolism, and cellular repair. These common transcriptional responses to stress appear coordinated by only a limited number of stress-inducible and redox-sensitive transcription factors and signal transduction pathways, such as the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun, the transcription factors NFkappaB and HIF-1alpha, and the JNK and p38 kinase signalling pathways. As an example of environmental stress responses, we present temperature response curves at organismal, cellular and molecular levels. Acclimation and physiological adjustments that can shift the threshold temperatures for the onset of these responses are discussed and include, for example, adjustments of the oxygen delivery system, the heat shock response, cellular repair system, and transcriptome. Ultimately, however, an organism's ability to cope with environmental change is largely determined by its ability to maintain aerobic scope and to prevent loss in performance. These systemic constraints can determine an organism's long-term survival well before cellular and molecular functions are disturbed. The conceptual model we propose here discusses some of the crosslinks between responses at different levels of biological organisation and the central role of oxygen balance and oxidative stress in eliciting these responses with the aim to help the interpretation of environmental genomic data in the context of organismal function and performance.","identifiers":{"pmid":"19344429"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19344429","stats":{"readers":16,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":94},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":6}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":19},{"name":"Canada","value":13},{"name":"Argentina","value":6}],"status":[{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":19},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":19},{"name":"Post Doc","value":13}]},"issue":"2","pages":"277-292","publication_outlet":"Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/animal-performance-and-stress-responses-and-tolerance-limits-at-different-levels-of-biological-organisation\/","uuid":"604ffe80-6d0a-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Karin S","surname":"Kassahn"},{"forename":"Ross H","surname":"Crozier"},{"forename":"Hans O","surname":"P\u00f6rtner"},{"forename":"M Julian","surname":"Caley"}],"title":"Animal performance and stress: responses and tolerance limits at different levels of biological organisation.","volume":"84","year":2009,"categories":[39,37,52,25,24,43,40,28,210,35,352],"oa_journal":false},"45898e40-9596-11df-96dc-0024e8453de8":{"abstract":"The existence of 'animal personality', i.e. consistent individual differences in behaviour across time and contexts, is an evolutionary puzzle that has recently generated considerable research interest.

In fact, the development of many animal and plant pathological conditions, as well as natural aging, is associated with excessive ROS production and\/or decreased antioxidant capacity. However, a number of animal species are able to tolerate, under natural conditions, situations posing a large potential for oxidative stress. Situations range from anoxia in fish, frogs and turtles, to severe hypoxia in organs of freeze-tolerant snakes, frogs and insect larvae, or diving seals and turtles, and mild hypoxia in organs of dehydrated frogs and toads or estivating snails. All situations are reminiscent of ischemia\/reperfusion events that are highly damaging to most mammals and birds. This article reviews the responses of anoxia\/hypoxia-tolerant animals when subjected to environmental and metabolic stresses leading to oxygen limitation. Abrupt changes in metabolic rate in ground squirrels arousing from hibernation, as well as snails arousing from estivation, may also set up a condition of increased ROS formation. Comparing the responses from these diverse animals, certain patterns emerge. The most commonly observed response is an enhancement of the antioxidant defense. The increase in the baseline activity of key antioxidant enzymes, as well as 'secondary' enzymatic defenses, and\/or glutathione levels in preparation for a putative oxidative stressful situation arising from tissue reoxygenation seem to be the preferred evolutionary adaptation. Increasing the overall antioxidant capacity during anoxia\/hypoxia is of relevance for species such as garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) and wood fogs (Rana sylvatica), while diving freshwater turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) appear to rely mainly upon high constitutive activities of antioxidant enzymes to deal with oxidative stress arising during tissue reoxygenation. The possibility that some animal species might control post-anoxic ROS generation cannot be excluded.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12458182","identifiers":{"pmid":"12458182"},"stats":{"readers":20,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":80},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":10},{"id":11,"name":"Engineering","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":10},{"name":"Hong Kong","value":5},{"name":"Spain","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":15},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":15},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":15}]},"issue":"4","pages":"537-556","publication_outlet":"Comparative biochemistry and physiology Toxicology pharmacology CBP","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/animal-response-to-drastic-changes-in-oxygen-availability-and-physiological-oxidative-stress\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"07c83e10-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Marcelo","surname":"Hermes-Lima"},{"forename":"Tania","surname":"Zenteno-Sav\u00edn"}],"title":"Animal response to drastic changes in oxygen availability and physiological oxidative stress.","volume":"133","year":2002,"categories":[35,43,24,193,331,28,44,210,352],"oa_journal":false},"5cd23880-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Network analysis has a long history in the mathematical and social sciences and the aim of this introduction is to provide a brief overview of the potential that it holds for the study of animal behaviour. One of the most attractive features of the network paradigm is that it provides a single conceptual framework with which we can study the social organisation of animals at all levels (individual, dyad, group, population) and for all types of interaction (aggressive, cooperative, sexual etc.). Graphical tools allow a visual inspection of networks which often helps inspire ideas for testable hypotheses. Network analysis itself provides a multitude of novel statistical tools that can be used to characterise social patterns in animal populations. Among the important insights that networks have facilitated is that indirect social connections matter. Interactions between individuals generate a social environment at the population level which in turn selects for behavioural strategies at the individual level. A social network is often a perfect means by which to represent heterogeneous relationships in a population. Probing the biological drivers for these heterogeneities, often as a function of time, forms the basis of many of the current uses of network analysis in the behavioural sciences.

During the 1990s it was realized that even the ingestion of dead worms in food fish can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, that these may be more prevalent than infection itself, and that this outcome could be associated with food preparations previously considered safe. Not only may allergic symptoms arise from infection by the parasites (\"gastroallergic anisakiasis\"), but true anaphylactic reactions can also occur following exposure to allergens from dead worms by food-borne, airborne, or skin contact routes. This review discusses A. simplex pathogenesis in humans, covering immune hypersensitivity reactions both in the context of a living infection and in terms of exposure to its allergens by other routes. Over the last 20 years, several studies have concentrated on A. simplex antigen characterization and innate as well as adaptive immune response to this parasite. Molecular characterization of Anisakis allergens and isolation of their encoding cDNAs is now an active field of research that should provide improved diagnostic tools in addition to tools with which to enhance our understanding of pathogenesis and controversial aspects of A. simplex allergy. We also discuss the potential relevance of parasite products such as allergens, proteinases, and proteinase inhibitors and the activation of basophils, eosinophils, and mast cells in the induction of A. simplex-related immune hypersensitivity states induced by exposure to the parasite, dead or alive.","website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2292572&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2292572","other":"0012-07","pmid":"18400801","pmc_id":"2292572","doi":"10.1128\/CMR.00012-07"},"stats":{"readers":16,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":81},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":6},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":6}],"country":[{"name":"Spain","value":31},{"name":"Russia","value":6},{"name":"Germany","value":13}],"status":[{"name":"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)","value":44},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":25},{"name":"Post Doc","value":13}]},"issue":"2","pages":"360-379, table of contents","publication_outlet":"Clinical Microbiology Reviews","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anisakis-simplex-from-obscure-infectious-worm-to-inducer-of-immune-hypersensitivity\/","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","uuid":"c267ccc0-6d09-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"M Teresa","surname":"Audicana"},{"forename":"Malcolm W","surname":"Kennedy"}],"title":"Anisakis simplex: from obscure infectious worm to inducer of immune hypersensitivity.","volume":"21","year":2008,"categories":[50,33,21,172,43,348,47,210,38,313,47],"groups":[{"profile_id":698441,"date_added":1283419915000,"group_id":422361}],"oa_journal":false},"cfa3a7b0-6d04-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"We analyzed the occurrence of molt and brood patches in resident passerines from four localities in south-central Brazil.

Molt started in October but was most widespread from the middle to the end of the rainy season, between December and April with a peak in February. Timing of the appearance of brood patches was not related to trophic guild (insectivores, frugivores, omnivores). Molt of flight feathers started at the end of the reproductive period, which varied slightly among trophic guilds. Molt and brood patch overlap occurred in little more than 4% of individual birds, or in less than 2% considering just those molting flight feathers.

The development of fungal and bacterial biomass and the carbon dynamics were studied during several months of degradation. The results show a bilateral antagonistic relationship between bacteria and fungi. After 3 months, fungal biomass accumulation was approximately 12 times higher in the absence than in the presence of bacteria. Bacterial biomass accumulation was about double in the absence of fungi compared to when fungi were present. Similar interactions developed between a natural assemblage of bacteria and five different fungal strains isolated from Phragmites litter (three identified hyphomycetes and two unidentified strains). Despite the great difference in biomass development between the treatments, the carbon metabolism was similar regardless of whether fungi and\/or bacteria were present alone or in coexistence.

Although the divergence observed at some host-resistance and parasite-infectivity genes is consistent with this, the long time periods typically required to study coevolution have so far prevented any direct empirical test. Here we show, using experimental populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its viral parasite, phage Phi2 (refs 10, 11), that the rate of molecular evolution in the phage was far higher when both bacterium and phage coevolved with each other than when phage evolved against a constant host genotype. Coevolution also resulted in far greater genetic divergence between replicate populations, which was correlated with the range of hosts that coevolved phage were able to infect. Consistent with this, the most rapidly evolving phage genes under coevolution were those involved in host infection. These results demonstrate, at both the genomic and phenotypic level, that antagonistic coevolution is a cause of rapid and divergent evolution, and is likely to be a major driver of evolutionary change within species.","tags":["coevolution","molecular evolution","evolution","natural selection","red queen hypothesis"],"keywords":["molecular evolution"],"website":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10373\/483","pages":"275-278","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antagonistic-coevolution-accelerates-molecular-evolution\/","volume":"464","categories":[411,201,193,462,21,80,23,455,25,24,385,331,210,90,35,32,101,38,310,43,40,41,46,47,44,379,119,51,48,52,51,35,352]},"0cace0b0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Remodelling its shape, or morphogenesis, is a fundamental property of living tissue.

Convergent extension (CE) of the axial mesoderm of vertebrates is an intensively studied model for morphogenetic processes that rely on cell rearrangement. It involves the intercalation of polarized cells perpendicular to the antero-posterior (AP) axis, which narrows and lengthens the tissue. Several genes have been identified that regulate cell behaviour underlying CE in zebrafish and Xenopus. Many of these are homologues of genes that control epithelial planar cell polarity in Drosophila. However, elongation of axial mesoderm must be also coordinated with the pattern of AP tissue specification to generate a normal larval morphology. At present, the long-range control that orients CE with respect to embryonic axes is not understood. Here we show that the chordamesoderm of Xenopus possesses an intrinsic AP polarity that is necessary for CE, functions in parallel to Wnt\/planar cell polarity signalling, and determines the direction of tissue elongation. The mechanism that establishes AP polarity involves graded activin-like signalling and directly links mesoderm AP patterning to CE.","identifiers":{"pmid":"15254540"},"website":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v430\/n6997\/suppinfo\/nature02620.html","stats":{"readers":14,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":86},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":14}],"country":[{"name":"France","value":14},{"name":"United States","value":7},{"name":"Canada","value":21}],"status":[{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":36},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":14},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":14}]},"issue":"6997","pages":"364-367","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anteroposterior-tissue-polarity-links-mesoderm-convergent-extension-to-axial-patterning\/","uuid":"0cace0b0-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Hiromasa","surname":"Ninomiya"},{"forename":"Richard P","surname":"Elinson"},{"forename":"Rudolf","surname":"Winklbauer"}],"title":"Antero-posterior tissue polarity links mesoderm convergent extension to axial patterning.","volume":"430","year":2004,"categories":[21,43,385,31,35,352,350,31],"groups":[{"profile_id":3747231,"date_added":1297907982000,"group_id":883991}],"oa_journal":false},"253e1060-6d06-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Most carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the burning of fossil fuels will eventually be absorbed by the ocean1, with potentially adverse consequences for marine biota2, 3, 4.

The implications of wildlife EIDs are twofold: emerging wildlife diseases cause direct and indirect loss of biodiversity and add to the threat of zoonotic disease emergence. Since human environmental changes are largely responsible for their emergence, the threats wildlife EIDs pose to biodiversity and human health represent yet another consequence of anthropogenic influence on ecosystems. We identify key areas where existing expertise in ecology, conservation biology, wildlife biology, veterinary medicine and the impact of environmental change would augment programs to investigate emerging diseases of humans, and we comment on the need for greater medical and microbiological input into the study of wildlife diseases.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11230820","identifiers":{"pmid":"11230820"},"stats":{"readers":59,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":73},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":12},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":8}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"United States","value":27},{"name":"Ghana","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":31},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":14},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":10}]},"issue":"2","pages":"103-116","publication_outlet":"Acta Tropica","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anthropogenic-environmental-change-and-the-emergence-of-infectious-diseases-in-wildlife\/","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"a4826c90-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"P","surname":"Daszak"},{"forename":"A A","surname":"Cunningham"},{"forename":"A D","surname":"Hyatt"}],"title":"Anthropogenic environmental change and the emergence of infectious diseases in wildlife.","volume":"78","year":2001,"categories":[35,201,37,43,434,40,348,119,50,424,157,320,52,331,210,201,320,41,47],"groups":[{"profile_id":2151601,"date_added":1305134119000,"group_id":1106941},{"profile_id":1942901,"date_added":1288623393000,"group_id":624971},{"profile_id":41236,"date_added":1285510561000,"group_id":463691},{"profile_id":2471181,"date_added":1285022702000,"group_id":453311},{"profile_id":41236,"date_added":1285003321000,"group_id":452571},{"profile_id":2090761,"date_added":1282050484000,"group_id":364451},{"profile_id":1403151,"date_added":1272573836000,"group_id":237721}],"oa_journal":false},"d5742dc0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Freshwater ecosystems have long been affected by numerous types of human interventions that have a negative impact on their water quality and ecological state. Fortunately, in most western countries the input of sewage to freshwater systems has been reduced, but eutrophication-related turbidity and loss of biodiversity remain major problems in many parts of the world. Such impacts prevent the achievement of a high or good ecological state, as defined by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) or other standards. This paper synthesizes and links the findings presented in the seven papers of this special profile, focusing on the effects of anthropogenic stressors on freshwater ecosystems and on how to maintain and restore ecological quality. The papers cover a broad range of research areas and methods, but are all centred on the relationship between dispersal barriers, the connectivity of waterways and the restoration of rivers and lakes. The construction of dams and reservoirs disturbs the natural functioning of many streams and rivers and shore-line development around lakes may reduce habitat complexity. New methods demonstrate how reservoirs may have a severe impact on the distribution and connectivity of fish populations, and new techniques illustrate the potential of using graph theory and connectivity models to illustrate the ecological implications. Hydromorphologically degraded rivers and streams can be restored by addition of wood debris, but 'passive' restoration via natural wood recruitment may be preferable. The most cost-effective way to restore streams may also include information campaigns to farmers on best management practices. Removal of zooplanktivorous fish often has marked positive effects on trophic structure in lakes, but there is a tendency to return to turbid conditions after 8-10 years or less unless fish removal is repeated. Synthesis and applications. Development of new methods, as well as derivation of more general conclusions from reviewing the effects of previous restoration efforts, are crucial to achieve progress in applied freshwater research. The papers contained in this Special Profile contribute on both counts, as well as illustrating the importance of well-designed research projects and monitoring programmes to record the effects of the interventions. Such efforts are vital if we are to improve our knowledge of freshwater systems and to elaborate the best and most cost-effective recommendations. They may also help in achieving a good ecological state or potential in water bodies by 2015, as demanded by the European WFD.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackwell-synergy.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1365-2664.2007.01426.x","identifiers":{"issn":"00218901","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2664.2007.01426.x"},"stats":{"readers":25,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":56},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":36},{"id":9,"name":"Education","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"Ghana","value":4},{"name":"Finland","value":4},{"name":"Spain","value":4}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":40},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":20},{"name":"Post Doc","value":12}]},"issue":"6","pages":"1089-1094","publication_outlet":"Journal of Applied Ecology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anthropogenic-impacts-on-lake-and-stream-ecosystems-and-approaches-to-restoration\/","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","uuid":"d5742dc0-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Martin","surname":"S\u00f8ndergaard"},{"forename":"Erik","surname":"Jeppesen"}],"title":"Anthropogenic impacts on lake and stream ecosystems, and approaches to restoration","volume":"44","year":2007,"categories":[201,39,36,37,159,52,387,43,209,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":32585,"date_added":1273480786000,"group_id":251881}],"oa_journal":false},"9a161410-6d00-11df-8e55-0026b95e43ca":{"abstract":"Today's surface ocean is saturated with respect to calcium carbonate, but increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are reducing ocean pH and carbonate ion concentrations, and thus the level of calcium carbonate saturation. Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organismssuch as corals and some planktonwill have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the oceancarbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.","keywords":["qh301 biology","gc oceanography"],"website":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nature04095","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:eprints.soton.ac.uk:24168","doi":"10.1038\/nature04095"},"stats":{"readers":164,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":52},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":23},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":19}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":29},{"name":"Philippines","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":34},{"name":"Post Doc","value":13},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":10}]},"issue":"7059","pages":"681-6","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anthropogenic-ocean-acidification-twentyfirst-century-impact-calcifying-organisms\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"9a161410-6d00-11df-8e55-0026b95e43ca","authors":[{"forename":"J C","surname":"Orr"},{"forename":"V J","surname":"Fabry"},{"forename":"O","surname":"Aumont"},{"forename":"L","surname":"Bopp"},{"forename":"S C","surname":"Doney"},{"forename":"R A","surname":"Feely"},{"forename":"A","surname":"Gnanadesikan"},{"forename":"N","surname":"Gruber"},{"forename":"A","surname":"Ishida"},{"forename":"F","surname":"Joos"},{"forename":"R M","surname":"Key"},{"forename":"K","surname":"Lindsay"},{"forename":"E","surname":"Maier-Reimer"},{"forename":"R","surname":"Matear"},{"forename":"P","surname":"Monfray"},{"forename":"A","surname":"Mouchet"},{"forename":"R G","surname":"Najjar"},{"forename":"G K","surname":"Plattner"},{"forename":"K B","surname":"Rodgers"},{"forename":"C L","surname":"Sabine"},{"forename":"J L","surname":"Sarmiento"},{"forename":"R","surname":"Schlitzer"},{"forename":"R D","surname":"Slater"},{"forename":"I J","surname":"Totterdell"},{"forename":"M F","surname":"Weirig"},{"forename":"Y","surname":"Yamanaka"},{"forename":"A","surname":"Yool"}],"title":"Anthropogenic ocean acidification over the twenty-first century and its impact on calcifying organisms","volume":"437","year":2005,"categories":[411,201,140,203,193,74,80,22,455,24,208,209,210,516,39,36,37,43,434,40,109,41,44,119,187,113,112,52,121,120],"groups":[{"profile_id":2090191,"date_added":1306422225000,"group_id":380041},{"profile_id":4714911,"date_added":1306367775000,"group_id":1103971},{"profile_id":3364671,"date_added":1304653849000,"group_id":1038051},{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1304429023000,"group_id":1086371},{"profile_id":3760681,"date_added":1300465338000,"group_id":966611},{"profile_id":3337701,"date_added":1295436370000,"group_id":806921},{"profile_id":2542951,"date_added":1292872548000,"group_id":749181},{"profile_id":517721,"date_added":1284664981000,"group_id":362191},{"profile_id":466561,"date_added":1284636768000,"group_id":442011},{"profile_id":147542,"date_added":1282689754000,"group_id":407401},{"profile_id":1741581,"date_added":1278647292000,"group_id":274421},{"profile_id":1059511,"date_added":1269814152000,"group_id":187951},{"profile_id":627101,"date_added":1265872528000,"group_id":129091}],"oa_journal":false},"eda43200-6d01-11df-a474-0026b95e3e23":{"abstract":"The development of a vaccine would provide an important new tool for the control of human hookworm infection. On the basis of successful vaccination of laboratory animals with living irradiated, third-stage hookworm larvae (L3), we examined the antibody responses of individuals from hookworm endemic areas of Brazil and China against the most abundant L3 secreted antigens, the ancylostoma secreted proteins, ASP-1 and ASP-2. Logistic regression was used to investigate the effects of antibody isotype responses to ASPs on the risk of an individual harboring heavy hookworm infection. A significant protective association was observed between increasing anti-ASP-2 IgE levels and the risk of heavy hookworm infection. To confirm that ASP-2 is a protective antigen, laboratory dogs were immunized with recombinant ASP-2 formulated with the GlaxoSmithKline Adjuvant, AS03. Sera obtained from the immunized dogs exhibited high geometric mean antibody titers, immunoprecipitated native ASP-2 from L3 extracts and localized the site of ASP-2 expression to the glandular esophagus and body channels exiting to the cuticle. The sera also exhibited an increased ability to inhibit migration of L3 through tissue in vitro relative to sera from AS03-injected controls. Upon L3 challenge, the ASP-2 vaccinated dogs exhibited significant reductions in fecal egg counts and intestinal hookworm burden. These findings provide strong support for the development of an effective recombinant vaccine against hookworm infection in humans.","identifiers":{"pmid":"16037096"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16037096","stats":{"readers":3,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":33},{"name":"Australia","value":33},{"name":"United Kingdom","value":33}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":33},{"name":"Post Doc","value":33},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":33}]},"issue":"12","pages":"1743-1745","publication_outlet":"The FASEB journal official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibodies-against-secreted-protein-hookworm-larvae-reduce-intensity-hookworm-infection-humans-vaccinated-laboratory-animals\/","uuid":"eda43200-6d01-11df-a474-0026b95e3e23","authors":[{"forename":"Jeffrey","surname":"Bethony"},{"forename":"Alex","surname":"Loukas"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Smout"},{"forename":"Simon","surname":"Brooker"},{"forename":"Susana","surname":"Mendez"},{"forename":"Jordan","surname":"Plieskatt"},{"forename":"Gaddam","surname":"Goud"},{"forename":"Maria Elena","surname":"Bottazzi"},{"forename":"Bin","surname":"Zhan"},{"forename":"Yan","surname":"Wang"},{"forename":"Angela","surname":"Williamson"},{"forename":"Sara","surname":"Lustigman"},{"forename":"Rodrigo","surname":"Correa-Oliveira"},{"forename":"Shuhua","surname":"Xiao"},{"forename":"Peter J","surname":"Hotez"}],"title":"Antibodies against a secreted protein from hookworm larvae reduce the intensity of hookworm infection in humans and vaccinated laboratory animals.","volume":"19","year":2005,"categories":[47,38,47],"oa_journal":false},"0fb1d400-e6ac-11df-a962-0024e8453de6":{"abstract":"Antibodies provide effective antiviral immunity despite the fact that viruses escape into cells when they infect. Here we show that antibodies remain attached to viruses after cell infection and mediate an intracellular immune response that disables virions in the cytosol. We have discovered that cells possess a cytosolic IgG receptor, tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21), which binds to antibodies with a higher affinity than any other IgG receptor in the human body. TRIM21 rapidly recruits to incoming antibody-bound virus and targets it to the proteasome via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Proteasomal targeting leads to rapid degradation of virions in the cytosol before translation of virally encoded genes. Infection experiments demonstrate that at physiological antibody concentrations TRIM21 neutralizes viral infection. These results reveal an intracellular arm of adaptive immunity in which the protection mediated by antibodies does not end at the cell membrane but continues inside the cell to provide a last line of defense against infection.","website":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.1014074107","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2993423","other":"201014074","pmid":"21045130","pmc_id":"2993423","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1014074107"},"stats":{"readers":61,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":84},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":10},{"id":21,"name":"Physics","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":28},{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"United Kingdom","value":30}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":38},{"name":"Post Doc","value":20},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":11}]},"issue":"46","pages":"19985-19990","publication_outlet":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibodies-mediate-intracellular-immunity-through-tripartite-motifcontaining-21-trim21\/","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","uuid":"0fb1d400-e6ac-11df-a962-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Donna L","surname":"Mallery"},{"forename":"William A","surname":"McEwan"},{"forename":"Susanna R","surname":"Bidgood"},{"forename":"Greg J","surname":"Towers"},{"forename":"Chris M","surname":"Johnson"},{"forename":"Leo C","surname":"James"}],"title":"Antibodies mediate intracellular immunity through tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21).","volume":"107","year":2010,"categories":[519,101,38,311,43,44,51,25,385,27,28,331,30,38],"oa_journal":false},"05bb46e0-fd98-11df-95f0-0024e8453de6":{"abstract":"Brain stimulation and imaging studies in humans have highlighted a key role for the prefrontal cortex in clinical depression; however, it remains unknown whether excitation or inhibition of prefrontal cortical neuronal activity is associated with antidepressant responses.

We also examined these genes in the ventral portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice after chronic social defeat stress, a mouse model of depression. In addition, we used viral vectors to overexpress channel rhodopsin 2 (a light-activated cation channel) in mouse mPFC to optogenetically drive \"burst\" patterns of cortical firing in vivo and examine the behavioral consequences. Prefrontal cortical tissue derived from clinically depressed humans displayed significant reductions in IEG expression, consistent with a deficit in neuronal activity within this brain region. Mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress exhibited similar reductions in levels of IEG expression in mPFC. Interestingly, some of these changes were not observed in defeated mice that escape the deleterious consequences of the stress, i.e., resilient animals. In those mice that expressed a strong depressive-like phenotype, i.e., susceptible animals, optogenetic stimulation of mPFC exerted potent antidepressant-like effects, without affecting general locomotor activity, anxiety-like behaviors, or social memory. These results indicate that the activity of the mPFC is a key determinant of depression-like behavior, as well as antidepressant responses.","website":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1523\/JNEUROSCI.1731-10.2010","identifiers":{"nihms_id":"255156","pmid":"21123555","pmc_id":"3004756"},"stats":{"readers":58,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":74},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":16},{"id":22,"name":"Psychology","value":7}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":47},{"name":"Portugal","value":7},{"name":"Spain","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":40},{"name":"Post Doc","value":19},{"name":"Assistant Professor","value":7}]},"issue":"48","pages":"16082-16090","publication_outlet":"Journal of Neuroscience","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antidepressant-effect-optogenetic-stimulation-medial-prefrontal-cortex\/","publisher":"Soc Neuroscience","uuid":"05bb46e0-fd98-11df-95f0-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Herbert E","surname":"Covington"},{"forename":"Mary Kay","surname":"Lobo"},{"forename":"Ian","surname":"Maze"},{"forename":"Vincent","surname":"Vialou"},{"forename":"James M","surname":"Hyman"},{"forename":"Samir","surname":"Zaman"},{"forename":"Quincey","surname":"LaPlant"},{"forename":"Ezekiel","surname":"Mouzon"},{"forename":"Subroto","surname":"Ghose"},{"forename":"Carol A","surname":"Tamminga"},{"forename":"Rachael L","surname":"Neve"},{"forename":"Karl","surname":"Deisseroth"},{"forename":"Eric J","surname":"Nestler"}],"title":"Antidepressant effect of optogenetic stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex.","volume":"30","year":2010,"categories":[411,310,43,379,463,462,398,23,219,455,24,335,27,331,35,352],"groups":[{"profile_id":24031,"date_added":1301472647000,"group_id":491791},{"profile_id":1035401,"date_added":1297891427000,"group_id":723321},{"profile_id":3220721,"date_added":1296934505000,"group_id":856641},{"profile_id":68202,"date_added":1292346145000,"group_id":736921},{"profile_id":68202,"date_added":1292345896000,"group_id":736901}],"oa_journal":false},"43f5a090-6d01-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antinociceptive, sedative and cardiopulmonary effects of subarachnoid and epidural administration of xylazine-lidocaine in xylazine-sedated calves.

MATERIALS: The calves were allocated randomly to receive two treatments, subarachnoid or epidural xylazine (0.025 mg kg(-1))-lidocaine (0.1 mg kg(-1)) diluted to a total volume of 5 mL with physiological saline. Prior to either epidural or subarachnoid injection, sedation was induced in all calves by intravenous administration of 0.1 mg kg(-1) xylazine. The quality and duration of antinociception and sedation were monitored. Areas of the cranial abdomen, umbilicus, and caudal abdomen were evaluated for antinociception using pinprick tests with a scoring system of 0-3 (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, complete). Sedation was assessed by using a 4-point scale (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, deep). The following cardiopulmonary variables were monitored: heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (f(R)), mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood pH, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)), bicarbonate (HCO(3)), base excess (BE), and oxygen saturation (SaO(2)). RESULTS: Xylazine sedation and subarachnoid xylazine-lidocaine resulted in significantly higher nociceptive block than the epidural technique. Moreover, subarachnoid xylazine-lidocaine induced a significantly longer duration of complete antinociception (median IQR) in the cranial abdomen (15.0 15.0-30.0 versus 7.5 1.3-10.0 minutes; p < 0.05) and umbilicus (45.0 32.5-57.5 versus 10.0 6.3-17.5 minutes; p < 0.05) compared with epidural xylazine-lidocaine. There was moderate sedation with both techniques. In both treatments, blood pH, MAP and PaO(2) decreased significantly, and PaCO(2) increased significantly during anaesthesia. No change was evident in HR, f(R), HCO(3,) BE, or SaO(2).

Distribution of means, medians, maximum, variances, and skewness (g1), for both GRS and body size, estimated in the local assemblage were compared, using null models, with the data extracted from the overall Cerrado species pool. The results indicated a clear macroecological relationship between GRS and body size and a decrease in local abundance when distance between the locality analyzed and species midpoint increased. According to null models, both body size and GRS values measured in the local assemblage can be considered a random sample from the regional species pool (Cerrado region).

Thus, macroecological results linked with local data on population dynamics supported the minimum viable population model.","identifiers":{"pmid":"15195363"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15195363","stats":{"readers":43,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":91},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":7},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":5},{"name":"Brazil","value":65},{"name":"United Kingdom","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":21},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":21},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":14}]},"issue":"1","pages":"41-52","publication_outlet":"Brazilian journal of biology Revista brasleira de biologia","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anurans-from-a-local-assemblage-in-central-brazil-linking-local-processes-with-macroecological-patterns\/","uuid":"3ad75670-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"J A","surname":"Diniz-Filho"},{"forename":"L M","surname":"Bini"},{"forename":"R P","surname":"Bastos"},{"forename":"C M","surname":"Vieira"},{"forename":"M C","surname":"Souza"},{"forename":"J A","surname":"Motta"},{"forename":"J P","surname":"Pombal J\u00fanior"},{"forename":"J C","surname":"Peixoto"}],"title":"Anurans from a local assemblage in central Brazil: linking local processes with macroecological patterns.","volume":"64","year":2004,"categories":[119,23,52,43,47,210,352],"oa_journal":false},"cc4c7ec0-cdee-11df-922b-0024e8453de6":{"keywords":["nematoda intestine","1916 intestinal parasites","aplectana artigasi n","chile","genus aplectana","henry","leptodactylidae frogs","nematode species","railliet","reptiles amphibians","sp","travassos 1931","yorke"],"identifiers":{"issn":"00740276","doi":"10.1590\/S0074-02761997000600007"},"website":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0074-02761997000600007&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en","stats":{"readers":4,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":100}],"country":[{"name":"Argentina","value":25},{"name":"Brazil","value":50}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":25},{"name":"Doctoral Student","value":25},{"name":"Post Doc","value":25}]},"issue":"January","pages":"767- 770","publication_outlet":"Mem\u00f3rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aplectana-artigasi-nsp-nematoda-cosmocercidae-from-the-frog-eupsophus-calcaratus-anura-leptodactylidae-in-southern-chile\/","uuid":"cc4c7ec0-cdee-11df-922b-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Sonia","surname":"Puga"},{"forename":"Patricio","surname":"Torres"}],"title":"Aplectana artigasi n . sp .

Many studies, however, relied on data obtained with the inhibitor apocynin (4'-hydroxy-3'methoxyacetophenone). Because the mode of action of apocynin, however, is elusive, we determined its mechanism of inhibition on vascular NADPH oxidases. In HEK293 cells overexpressing NADPH oxidase isoforms (Nox1, Nox2, or Nox4), apocynin failed to inhibit superoxide anion generation detected by lucigenin chemiluminescence. In contrast, apocynin interfered with the detection of reactive oxygen species in assay systems selective for hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl radicals. Importantly, apocynin interfered directly with the detection of peroxides but not superoxide, if generated by xanthine\/xanthine oxidase or nonenzymatic systems. In leukocytes, apocynin is a prodrug that is activated by myeloperoxidase, a process that results in the formation of apocynin dimers. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells failed to form these dimers and, therefore, are not able to activate apocynin. Dimer formation was, however, observed in Nox-overexpressing HEK293 cells when myeloperoxidase was supplemented. As a consequence, apocynin should only inhibit NADPH oxidase in leukocytes, whereas in vascular cells, the compound could act as an antioxidant. Indeed, in vascular smooth muscle cells, the activation of the redox-sensitive kinases p38-mitogen-activate protein kinase, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1\/2 by hydrogen peroxide and by the intracellular radical generator menadione was prevented in the presence of apocynin. These observations indicate that apocynin predominantly acts as an antioxidant in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells and should not be used as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor in vascular systems.","identifiers":{"pmid":"18086956"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18086956","stats":{"readers":19,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":58},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":37},{"id":11,"name":"Engineering","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":37},{"name":"","value":5},{"name":"Czech Republic","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":53},{"name":"Post Doc","value":11},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":11}]},"issue":"2","pages":"211-217","publication_outlet":"Hypertension","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apocynin-is-not-an-inhibitor-of-vascular-nadph-oxidases-but-an-antioxidant\/","uuid":"63f50b50-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Sabine","surname":"Heum\u00fcller"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"Wind"},{"forename":"Eduardo","surname":"Barbosa-Sicard"},{"forename":"Harald H H W","surname":"Schmidt"},{"forename":"Rudi","surname":"Busse"},{"forename":"Katrin","surname":"Schr\u00f6der"},{"forename":"Ralf P","surname":"Brandes"}],"title":"Apocynin is not an inhibitor of vascular NADPH oxidases but an antioxidant.","volume":"51","year":2008,"categories":[38,24,350,312,43,332,193,331,291,350],"oa_journal":false},"f8be68a0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Naturally occurring axonal pruning and neuronal cell death help to sculpt neuronal connections during development, but their mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Here we report that beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21) activate a widespread caspase-dependent self-destruction program. DR6 is broadly expressed by developing neurons, and is required for normal cell body death and axonal pruning both in vivo and after trophic-factor deprivation in vitro. Unlike neuronal cell body apoptosis, which requires caspase 3, we show that axonal degeneration requires caspase 6, which is activated in a punctate pattern that parallels the pattern of axonal fragmentation. DR6 is activated locally by an inactive surface ligand(s) that is released in an active form after trophic-factor deprivation, and we identify APP as a DR6 ligand. Trophic-factor deprivation triggers the shedding of surface APP in a beta-secretase (BACE)-dependent manner. Loss- and gain-of-function studies support a model in which a cleaved amino-terminal fragment of APP (N-APP) binds DR6 and triggers degeneration. Genetic support is provided by a common neuromuscular junction phenotype in mutant mice. Our results indicate that APP and DR6 are components of a neuronal self-destruction pathway, and suggest that an extracellular fragment of APP, acting via DR6 and caspase 6, contributes to Alzheimer's disease.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19225519","identifiers":{"nihms_id":"98640","pmid":"19225519","pmc_id":"2677572"},"stats":{"readers":119,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":78},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":10},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":1},{"name":"","value":3},{"name":"United States","value":33}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":36},{"name":"Post Doc","value":16},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":11}]},"issue":"7232","pages":"981-989","publication_outlet":"Nature","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/app-binds-dr6-to-trigger-axon-pruning-and-neuron-death-via-distinct-caspases\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"f8be68a0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Anatoly","surname":"Nikolaev"},{"forename":"Todd","surname":"McLaughlin"},{"forename":"Dennis D M","surname":"O'Leary"},{"forename":"Marc","surname":"Tessier-Lavigne"}],"title":"APP binds DR6 to trigger axon pruning and neuron death via distinct caspases.","volume":"457","year":2009,"categories":[35,411,207,3,101,38,350,43,193,44,378,462,80,82,52,387,334,25,335,28,331,35],"groups":[{"profile_id":2921561,"date_added":1297696481000,"group_id":655721},{"profile_id":486151,"date_added":1287486124000,"group_id":90071},{"profile_id":2277031,"date_added":1286358454000,"group_id":424241},{"profile_id":2319931,"date_added":1283772636000,"group_id":418941},{"profile_id":25470,"date_added":1281686063000,"group_id":328981}],"oa_journal":false},"700c1780-6d0c-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Important applications of diagnostic tests in non-clinical areas of veterinary medicine include surveillance, monitoring or screening for disease, prevalence estimation, and risk-factor studies.

However, designation of reserves has been largely opportunistic, or protective measures have been implemented (often overlapping and sometimes in conflict) by different entities seeking to achieve different ends. This has created confusion among both users and enforcers, and the proliferation of different measures provides a false sense of protection where little is offered. This paper sets out a procedure grounded in current understanding of ecological processes, that allows the evaluation and selection of reserve sites in order to develop functional, interconnected networks of fully protected reserves that will fulfill multiple objectives. By fully protected we mean permanently closed to fishing and other resource extraction. We provide a framework that unifies the central aims of conservation and fishery management, while also meeting other human needs such as the provision of ecosystem services (e.g., maintenance of coastal water quality, shoreline protection, and recreational opportunities). In our scheme, candidate sites for reserves are evaluated against 12 criteria focused toward sustaining the biological integrity and productivity of marine systems at both local and regional scales. While a limited number of sites will be indispensable in a network, many will be of similar value as reserves, allowing the design of numerous alternative, biologically adequate networks. Devising multiple network designs will help ensure that ecological functionality is preserved throughout the socioeconomic evaluation process. Too often, socioeconomic criteria have dominated the process of reserve selection, potentially undermining their efficacy. We argue that application of biological criteria must precede and inform socioeconomic evaluation, since maintenance of ecosystem functioning is essential for meeting all of the goals for reserves. It is critical that stakeholders are fully involved throughout this process. Application of the proposed criteria will lead to networks whose multifunctionality will help unite the objectives of different management entities, so accelerating progress toward improved stewardship of the oceans.","website":"http:\/\/eprints.whiterose.ac.uk\/344\/","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:eprints.whiterose.ac.uk:344"},"stats":{"readers":71,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":65},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":28},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":6}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":30},{"name":"Portugal","value":7},{"name":"Philippines","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)","value":15},{"name":"Post Doc","value":10}]},"issue":"1","pages":"215-228","public_file_hash":"d33c6315bcacd8ee28dd0903e1c53ccbb25552d2","publication_outlet":"Ecological Applications","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-of-ecological-criteria-in-selecting-marine-reserves-and-developing-reserve-networks\/","publisher":"Eco Soc America","uuid":"edbc11b0-6cff-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"C M","surname":"Roberts"},{"forename":"G","surname":"Branch"},{"forename":"R H","surname":"Bustmante"},{"forename":"J C","surname":"Castilla"},{"forename":"J","surname":"Dugan"},{"forename":"B S","surname":"Halpern"},{"forename":"K D","surname":"Lafferty"},{"forename":"H","surname":"Leslie"},{"forename":"J","surname":"Lubchenco"},{"forename":"D","surname":"McArdle"},{"forename":"M","surname":"Ruckelshaus"},{"forename":"R R","surname":"Warner"}],"title":"Application of ecological criteria in selecting marine reserves and developing reserve networks","volume":"13","year":2003,"categories":[119,35,201,203,37,43,434,40,208,210,120],"groups":[{"profile_id":2999671,"date_added":1297800069000,"group_id":883371},{"profile_id":2148181,"date_added":1294935791000,"group_id":792521},{"profile_id":2115531,"date_added":1288233229000,"group_id":598311}],"oa_journal":false},"eabe6210-6cff-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"identifiers":{"pmid":"19287448"},"stats":{"readers":149,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":87},{"id":19,"name":"Medicine","value":3},{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":22},{"name":"Portugal","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":32},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":13},{"name":"Post Doc","value":12}]},"issue":"4","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Nature Reviews Microbiology","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"eabe6210-6cff-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"Daniel","surname":"MacLean"},{"forename":"Jonathan D G","surname":"Jones"},{"forename":"David J","surname":"Studholme"}],"title":"Application of 'next-generation' sequencing technologies to microbial genetics.","year":2009,"groups":[{"profile_id":2891181,"date_added":1303328056000,"group_id":1054251},{"profile_id":3942731,"date_added":1302520262000,"group_id":938651},{"profile_id":588211,"date_added":1302018559000,"group_id":293221},{"profile_id":21397,"date_added":1296574413000,"group_id":844051},{"profile_id":3461571,"date_added":1296440754000,"group_id":806291},{"profile_id":2654051,"date_added":1286859856000,"group_id":576891},{"profile_id":73872,"date_added":1264605504000,"group_id":503131},{"profile_id":5995,"date_added":1257259807000,"group_id":1298},{"profile_id":7653,"date_added":1237499889000,"group_id":485}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"New sequencing methods generate data that can allow the assembly of microbial genome sequences in days.

The Pseudomonas and Listeria models provided satisfactory predictions concerning inoculated strains grown in decontaminated beef meat. It was also possible to use the Pseudomonas models to predict the growth of the natural flora (mainly Pseudomonas spp.) of refrigerated meat stored under aerobic conditions. In experiments with mixed populations, three situations were observed: (1) in decontaminated meat, L. monocytogenes inoculated alone grew well at 6 degrees C, and this result was correctly predicted by the model; (2) in decontaminated meat inoculated with Listeria and Pseudomonas strains, L. innocua grew well and was not affected by the presence of Pseudomonas, and the growth of both organisms was correctly predicted by the models; (3) in naturally contaminated meat inoculated with Listeria, the strain did not grow until Pseudomonas had reached the stationary phase. The models satisfactorily predicted the growth of Pseudomonas spp. but not that of Listeria. In conclusion, the Lm14 model cannot be used for refrigerated meat stored aerobically as the results suggest a 'fail-safe' level which may be too high: meat had already reached a spoilage state even though no increase in the level of Listeria was observed.

Understanding of leaf reflectance has lead to various vegetative indices for crop canopies to quantify various agronomic parameters, e.g., leaf area, crop cover, biomass, crop type, nutrient status, and yield. Emittance from crop canopies is a measure of leaf temperature and infrared thermometers have fostered crop stress indices currently used to quantify water requirements.

Haplotype-based analysis is more informative than analysis based on individual SNPs, and has more power in analyzing association with phenotypes. The elite germplasm of some crops may have been subjected to bottlenecks relatively recently, increasing the amount of linkage disequilibrium (LD) present and facilitating the association of SNP haplotypes at candidate gene loci with phenotypes.

Historical perspectives increase our understanding of the dynamic nature of landscapes and provide a frame of reference for assessing modern patterns and processes. Historical records, however, are often too brief or fragmentary to be useful, or they are not obtainable for the process or structure of interest. Even where long historical time series can be assembled, selection of appropriate reference conditions may be complicated by the past influence of humans and the many potential reference conditions encompassed by nonequilibrium dynamics. These complications, however, do not lessen the value of history; rather they underscore the need for multiple, comparative histories from many locations for evaluating both cultural and natural causes of variability, as well as for characterizing the overall dynamical properties of ecosystems. Historical knowledge may not simplify the task of setting management goals and making decisions, but 20th century trends, such as increasingly severe wildfires, suggest that disregarding history can be perilous. We describe examples from our research in the southwestern United States to illustrate some of the values and limitations of applied historical ecology. Paleoecological data from packrat middens and other natural archives have been useful for defining baseline conditions of vegetation communities, determining histories and rates of species range expansions and contractions, and discriminating between natural and cultural causes of environmental change. We describe a montane grassland restoration project in northern New Mexico that was justified and guided by an historical sequence of aerial photographs showing progressive tree invasion during the 20th century. Likewise, fire scar chronologies have been widely used to justify and guide fuel reduction and natural fire reintroduction in forests. A southwestern network of fire histories illustrates the power of aggregating historical time series across spatial scales. Regional fire patterns evident in these aggregations point to the key role of interannual lags in responses of fuels and fire regimes to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (wet\/dry cycles), with important implications for long-range fire hazard forecasting. These examples of applied historical ecology emphasize that detection and explanation of historical trends and variability are essential to informed management.","tags":["climate-fire","veg-fire"],"keywords":["climate change","disturbance","fire history","historical ecology","leoecology","pa","packrat middens","range natural variation","repeat photography","restoration","southwestern united states","tree rings","vegetation change"],"website":"http:\/\/www.esajournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1890\/1051-0761%281999%29009%5B1189%3AAHEUTP%5D2.0.CO%3B2","pages":"1189-1206","public_file_hash":"b40d27dca90df0f64f0285c620ac4775a30df69b","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/applied-historical-ecology-using-the-past-to-manage-for-the-future\/","volume":"9","categories":[34,35,101,206,201,203,43,40,434,119,49,48,430,29,210,121]},"b31380d0-6d08-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"issn":"00401706","isbn":"0387982183","doi":"10.2307\/1270654"},"website":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/1270654?origin=crossref","stats":{"readers":57,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":32},{"id":22,"name":"Psychology","value":9},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":9}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":21},{"name":"Iran","value":2},{"name":"Philippines","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":37},{"name":"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)","value":11},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":9}]},"issue":"2","pages":"156","publication_outlet":"Technometrics","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/applying-generalized-linear-models-1\/","publisher":"Springer","uuid":"b31380d0-6d08-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Hanfeng","surname":"Chen"}],"title":"Applying Generalized Linear Models","volume":"40","year":1998,"categories":[137,411,272,201,140,9,193,407,461,397,23,144,92,452,26,208,29,210,448,441,101,37,43,40,434,109,186,185,190,176,300,303],"groups":[{"profile_id":553351,"date_added":1301587371000,"group_id":976891},{"profile_id":1071701,"date_added":1292955153000,"group_id":751471},{"profile_id":553351,"date_added":1282843013000,"group_id":412711},{"profile_id":268062,"date_added":1271361405000,"group_id":214391}],"oa_journal":false},"b0503bc0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["matorral"],"abstract":"After a millenarian history of overexploitation, most forests in the Mediterranean Basin have disappeared, leaving many degraded landscapes that have been recolonized by early successional shrub-dominated communities. Common reforestation techniques treat these shrubs as competitors against newly planted tree seedlings; thus shrubs are cleared before tree plantation. However, empirical studies and theory governing plant-plant interactions suggest that, in stress-prone Mediterranean environments, shrubs can have a net positive effect on recruitment of other species. Between 1997 and 2001, we carried out experimental reforestations in the Sierra Nevada Protected Area (southeast Spain) with the aim of comparing the survival and growth of seedlings planted in open areas (the current reforestation technique) with seedlings planted under the canopy of preexisting shrub species. Over 18000 seedlings of 11 woody species were planted under 16 different nurse shrubs throughout a broad geographical area. We sought to explore variation in the sign and magnitude of interactions along spatial gradients defined by altitude and aspect. In the present work, we report the results of a meta-analysis conducted with seedling survival and growth data for the first summer following planting, the most critical period for reforestation success in Mediterranean areas. The facilitative effect was consistent in all environmental situations explored (grand mean effect size d(+) = 0.89 for survival and 0.27 for growth). However, there were differences in the magnitude of the interaction, depending on the seedling species planted as well as the nurse shrub species involved. Additionally, nurse shrubs had a stronger facilitative effect on seedling survival and growth at low attitudes and sunny, drier slopes than at high altitudes or shady, wetter slopes. Facilitation in the dry years proved higher than in the one wet year. Our results show that pioneer shrubs facilitate the establishment of woody, late-successional Mediterranean species and thus can positively affect reforestation success in many different ecological settings.","keywords":["abiotic stress","ecological succession","mediterranean mountains","meta analysis","nurse","plant","plant interactions","reforestation","shrubs","spatial temporal variability","tree shrub seed"],"website":"http:\/\/www.esajournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1890\/03-5084","identifiers":{"issn":"10510761","doi":"10.1890\/03-5084"},"stats":{"readers":47,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":70},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":26},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":4}],"country":[{"name":"Panama","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":11},{"name":"Portugal","value":6}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":36},{"name":"Post Doc","value":15},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":15}]},"issue":"4","pages":"1128-1138","publication_outlet":"Ecological Applications","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/applying-plant-facilitation-to-forest-restoration-a-metaanalysis-of-the-use-of-shrubs-as-nurse-plants\/","publisher":"Eco Soc America","uuid":"b0503bc0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Lorena","surname":"G\u00f3mez-Aparicio"},{"forename":"R","surname":"Zamora"},{"forename":"Jose M","surname":"G\u00f3mez"},{"forename":"Jose A","surname":"H\u00f3dar"},{"forename":"J","surname":"Castro"},{"forename":"E","surname":"Baraza"}],"title":"APPLYING PLANT FACILITATION TO FOREST RESTORATION : A META-ANALYSIS OF THE USE OF SHRUBS AS NURSE PLANTS","volume":"14","year":2004,"categories":[119,34,116,48,201,52,43,29,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":157362,"date_added":1287605404000,"group_id":249721},{"profile_id":665501,"date_added":1281635505000,"group_id":393211}],"oa_journal":false},"379300e0-6d01-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2":{"abstract":"Acute abdomen is a common clinical complaint identified in small animal patients.

For protein pharmaceuticals, plant systems are inherently safer than native and even recombinant animal sources. In addition, post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which cannot be achieved with bacterial fermentation, can be accomplished using plants. The main advantage foreseen for plant systems is reduced production costs. Plants should have a particular advantage for proteins produced in bulk, such as industrial enzymes, for which product pricing is low. In addition, edible plant tissues are well suited to the expression of vaccine antigens and pharmaceuticals for oral delivery. Three approaches have been followed to express recombinant proteins in plants: expression from the plant nuclear genome; expression from the plastid genome; and expression from plant tissues carrying recombinant plant viral sequences. The most important factor in moving plant-produced heterologous proteins from developmental research to commercial products is to ensure competitive production costs, and the best way to achieve this is to boost expression. Thus, considerable research effort has been made to increase the amount of recombinant protein produced in plants. This research includes molecular technologies to increase replication, to boost transcription, to direct transcription in tissues suited for protein accumulation, to stabilize transcripts, to optimize translation, to target proteins to subcellular locations optimal for their accumulation, and to engineer proteins to stabilize them. Other methods include plant breeding to increase transgene copy number and to utilize germplasm suited to protein accumulation.

Because access to wildlife areas is one major means of increasing their public value, and hence the pressure to conserve them, it is clearly critical to be able to identify accurately when human presence is a threat to conservation and when it is not. A wide range of methods have been used to assess the impacts of human disturbance on wildlife and these methods are summarized here.

This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.","tags":["abc","genetics","p01314"],"website":"http:\/\/opus.bath.ac.uk\/7427\/","pages":"2025-2035","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/approximate-bayesian-computation-in-population-genetics\/","volume":"162","categories":[409,201,140,203,129,21,322,212,455,27,29,331,210,35,32,101,98,43,434,40,44,48,52,298,300,303,35,26]},"44833660-6d08-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["ecology"],"abstract":"The widespread emergence of human and wildlife diseases has challenged ecologists to understand how large-scale agents of environmental change affect hostpathogen interactions. Accelerated eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems owing to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment is a pervasive form of environmental change that has been implicated in the emergence of diseases through direct and indirect pathways. We provide experimental evidence linking eutrophication and disease in a multihost parasite system. The trematode parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae sequentially infects birds, snails, and amphibian larvae, frequently causing severe limb deformities and mortality. Eutrophication has been implicated in the emergence of this parasite, but definitive evidence, as well as a mechanistic understanding, have been lacking until now. We show that the effects of eutrophication cascade through the parasite life cycle to promote algal production, the density of snail hosts, and, ultimately, the intensity of infection in amphibians. Infection also negatively affected the survival of developing amphibians. Mechanistically, eutrophication promoted amphibian disease through two distinctive pathways: by increasing the density of infected snail hosts and by enhancing per-snail production of infectious parasites. Given forecasted increases in global eutrophication, amphibian extinctions, and similarities between Ribeiroia and important human and wildlife pathogens, our results have broad epidemiological and ecological significance.","website":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2000446&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2000446","other":"7766","pmid":"17893332","pmc_id":"2000446","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0707763104"},"stats":{"readers":39,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":77},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":18},{"id":11,"name":"Engineering","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":46},{"name":"Ghana","value":3},{"name":"Czech Republic","value":3}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":26},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":23},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":13}]},"issue":"40","pages":"15781-15786","publication_outlet":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aquatic-eutrophication-promotes-pathogenic-infection-in-amphibians\/","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","uuid":"44833660-6d08-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Pieter T J","surname":"Johnson"},{"forename":"Jonathan M","surname":"Chase"},{"forename":"Katherine L","surname":"Dosch"},{"forename":"Richard B","surname":"Hartson"},{"forename":"Jackson A","surname":"Gross"},{"forename":"Don J","surname":"Larson"},{"forename":"Daniel R","surname":"Sutherland"},{"forename":"Stephen R","surname":"Carpenter"}],"title":"Aquatic eutrophication promotes pathogenic infection in amphibians.","volume":"104","year":2007,"categories":[34,201,39,36,188,52,24,43,29,300,47,210,47,209],"oa_journal":false},"57847e60-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"1. Riverine systems consist of a mosaic of patches and habitats linked by diverse processes and supporting highly complex communities. Invertebrates show a high taxonomic and functional diversity in riverine systems and are in several ways important components of these systems. Their distribution patterns, movements and effects on ecological flows, testify to their importance in various landscape ecological processes. This paper reviews the invertebrate literature with respect to patterns and processes in the riverine landscape. 2. The distribution of invertebrates in riverine habitats is governed by a number of factors that typically act at different scales. Hence, the local community structure can be seen as the result of a continuous sorting process through environmental filters ranging from regional or catchment-wide processes, involving speciation, geological history and climate, to the small-scale characteristics of individual patches, such as local predation risk, substratum porosity and current velocity. 3. Dispersal is an important process driving invertebrate distribution, linking different ecological systems across boundaries. Dispersal occurs within the aquatic habitat as well as into the terrestrial surrounding, and also over land to other waterbodies. New genetic techniques have contributed significantly to the understanding of aquatic invertebrate dispersal and revealed the importance of factors such as physical barriers, synchrony of emergence and taxonomic affiliation. 4. Invertebrates affect the cycling of nutrients and carbon by being a crucial intermediate link between primary producers, detritus pools or primary consumers, and predators higher up in the trophic hierarchy. Suspension feeders increase the retention of carbon. The subsidies of aquatic invertebrates to the terrestrial ecosystem have been shown to be important, as are reciprocal processes such as the supply of terrestrial invertebrates that fall into the water. 5. Future studies are needed both to advance theoretical aspects of landscape ecology pertaining to the invertebrates in riverine systems and to intensify the experimental testing of hypotheses, for example with respect to the scaling of processes and to linkages between the terrestrial and aquatic systems. Another promising avenue is to take advantage of naturally steep environmental gradients, and of systems disturbed by humans, such as regulated rivers. By comparison with unimpaired reference sites, the mechanisms involved might be identified. The use of 'natural' experiments, especially where environmental gradients are steep, is another technique with great potential.","keywords":["dispersal","insects","riparian zone","rivers","se 90187 umea","streams","university"],"website":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1046\/j.1365-2427.2002.00895.x","identifiers":{"issn":"00465070","doi":"10.1046\/j.1365-2427.2002.00895.x"},"stats":{"readers":63,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":68},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":29},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":22},{"name":"Portugal","value":3},{"name":"Hong Kong","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":25},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":24},{"name":"Student (Postgraduate)","value":10}]},"issue":"4","pages":"679-694","public_file_hash":"c47b31e62cc5f921d0237d17d56a7ee7c932e5d3","publication_outlet":"Freshwater Biology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aquatic-invertebrates-in-riverine-landscapes\/","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","uuid":"57847e60-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Bjorn","surname":"Malmqvist"}],"title":"Aquatic invertebrates in riverine landscapes","volume":"47","year":2002,"categories":[32,201,39,36,37,43,40,119,48,23,188,52,29,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":173312,"date_added":1256764102000,"group_id":29402}],"oa_journal":false},"f16aba70-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"In the present investigation we studied the feeding habits of the fishes associated with aquatic macrophytes in the Rosana Reservoir, southeastern Brazil.

In the past decade we have learned a great deal about some of the factors that regulate bacteria and their activities, and how these activities, in turn, alter ecosystem-level processes. Here I review three areas in which recent progress has been made with particular reference to pelagic ecosystems: the problem of bacterial cell dormancy; the effect of solar radiation on organic matter lability; and, the maintenance of net heterotrophy. In a system in which grazing is the major source of mortality for bacteria, bacterial cell dormancy is something of a paradox. I argue that the degree to which bacteria are grazed by flagellates (highly selective grazers) versus other grazers (cladocerans, bivalves) may explain the degree and variation in the proportion of active cells which recent evidence shows to be large. Another factor affecting bacterial activity that has come to the fore in recent years is solar radiation. Irradiation, especially in the ultra-violet range has long been thought of as simply deleterious to some bacteria. A wealth of newer evidence shows that refractory dissolved organic compounds may be converted into microbially labile compounds by solar radiation in several wavebands. This interaction between irradiation and organic matter (photolysis) may explain, in part, how dissolved organic carbon (C) may be refractory in the dark environment of the soil but become labile in the illumunated surface waters of lakes or rivers. The newer evidence shows that aquatic ecosystems, at least oligotrophic ones, are significantly subsidized by terrestrially-produced organic matter. I review here multiple lines of evidence that suggest that freshwater ecosystems are predominantly systems which respire more organic C than they produce by photosynthesis, and are therefore net heterotrophic. While net heterotrophy is an interesting exception for terrestrial ecosystems, it appears to be commonplace for aquatic systems and represents an important linkage between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.","keywords":["aquatic microbiol","ecosystems","microbial ecology","ogy","review"],"website":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/openurl.asp?genre=article&id=doi:10.1007\/s100219900069","identifiers":{"issn":"14329840","doi":"10.1007\/s100219900069"},"stats":{"readers":20,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":50},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":40},{"id":7,"name":"Earth Sciences","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":40},{"name":"Portugal","value":5},{"name":"Mexico","value":5}],"status":[{"name":"Post Doc","value":30},{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":15},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":15}]},"issue":"3","pages":"215-225","publication_outlet":"Ecosystems","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aquatic-microbiology-for-ecosystem-scientists-new-and-recycled-paradigms-in-ecological-microbiology\/","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","uuid":"7b6776d0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Jonathan J","surname":"Cole"}],"title":"Aquatic Microbiology for Ecosystem Scientists: New and Recycled Paradigms in Ecological Microbiology","volume":"2","year":1999,"categories":[119,201,39,80,43,41,209,210],"groups":[{"profile_id":856881,"date_added":1294362418000,"group_id":347211},{"profile_id":173312,"date_added":1256764102000,"group_id":29402}],"oa_journal":false},"8129c4b0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"tags":["arabidopsis","arabidopsis proteins","culture techniques","folder - others - plants","gene expression regulation- plant","protoplasts","signal transduction","transfection"],"abstract":"The transient gene expression system using Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts has proven an important and versatile tool for conducting cell-based experiments using molecular, cellular, biochemical, genetic, genomic and proteomic approaches to analyze the functions of diverse signaling pathways and cellular machineries.

In return, up to 20% of plant-fixed carbon is transferred to the fungus. Nutrient transport occurs through symbiotic structures inside plant root cells known as arbuscules. AM development is accompanied by an exchange of signalling molecules between the symbionts. A novel class of plant hormones known as strigolactones are exuded by the plant roots. On the one hand, strigolactones stimulate fungal metabolism and branching. On the other hand, they also trigger seed germination of parasitic plants. Fungi release signalling molecules, in the form of 'Myc factors' that trigger symbiotic root responses. Plant genes required for AM development have been characterized. During evolution, the genetic programme for AM has been recruited for other plant root symbioses: functional adaptation of a plant receptor kinase that is essential for AM symbiosis paved the way for nitrogen-fixing bacteria to form intracellular symbioses with plant cells.","website":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18794914","identifiers":{"pmid":"18794914"},"stats":{"readers":78,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":91},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":8},{"id":5,"name":"Chemistry","value":1}],"country":[{"name":"Panama","value":1},{"name":"United States","value":26},{"name":"Greece","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":29},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":21},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":13}]},"issue":"10","pages":"763-775","publication_outlet":"Nature Reviews Microbiology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arbuscular-mycorrhiza-the-mother-of-plant-root-endosymbioses\/","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","uuid":"b09940c0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Parniske"}],"title":"Arbuscular mycorrhiza: the mother of plant root endosymbioses.","volume":"6","year":2008,"categories":[35,201,43,41,44,45,49,48,21,80,29,210,211,30,35,352,41],"groups":[{"profile_id":2348861,"date_added":1294867115000,"group_id":616401},{"profile_id":1289091,"date_added":1280157448000,"group_id":220021}],"oa_journal":false},"241333b0-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"Archaea (archaebacteria) are a phenotypically diverse group of microorganisms that share a common evolutionary history. There are four general phenotypic groups of archaea: the methanogens, the extreme halophiles, the sulfate-reducing archaea, and the extreme thermophiles. In the marine environment, archaeal habitats are generally limited to shallow or deep-sea anaerobic sediments (free-living and endosymbiotic methanogens), hot springs or deep-sea hydrothermal vents (methanogens, sulfate reducers, and extreme thermophiles), and highly saline land-locked seas (halophiles). This report provides evidence for the widespread occurrence of unusual archaea in oxygenated coastal surface waters of North America. Quantitative estimates indicated that up to 2% of the total ribosomal RNA extracted from coastal bacterioplankton assemblages was archaeal. Archaeal small-subunit ribosomal RNA-encoding DNAs (rDNAs) were cloned from mixed bacterioplankton populations collected at geographically distant sampling sites. Phylogenetic and nucleotide signature analyses of these cloned rDNAs revealed the presence of two lineages of archaea, each sharing the diagnostic signatures and structural features previously established for the domain Archaea. Both of these lineages were found in bacterioplankton populations collected off the east and west coasts of North America. The abundance and distribution of these archaea in oxic coastal surface waters suggests that these microorganisms represent undescribed physiological types of archaea, which reside and compete with aerobic, mesophilic eubacteria in marine coastal environments.

We investigated the abundance of the gene encoding a subunit of the key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) in 12 pristine and agricultural soils of three climatic zones. amoA gene copies of Crenarchaeota (Archaea) were up to 3,000-fold more abundant than bacterial amoA genes. High amounts of crenarchaeota-specific lipids, including crenarchaeol, correlated with the abundance of archaeal amoA gene copies. Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative PCR studies and complementary DNA analysis using novel cloning-independent pyrosequencing technology demonstrated the activity of the archaea in situ and supported the numerical dominance of archaeal over bacterial ammonia oxidizers.

In addition to the correspondence between RNA and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of RNA structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in HIV proteins. This correlation suggests that RNA structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding.

Evolutionary psychologists claim that our preference for symmetry can be explained in the context of mate choice because symmetry is an honest indicator of the genetic quality of potential mates. These arguments assume that asymmetry in human faces is fluctuating asymmetry (FA), because this form of asymmetry can be revealing of developmental instability. However, no study has yet examined the characteristics of facial asymmetry. Here we provide the first detailed study of the patterns of asymmetry in human faces. We measured asymmetry in 35 facial traits. Although some traits had distributions characteristic of FA, many had distributions that characterize directional asymmetry (DA); on average, both men and women had right hemi-face dominance. For DA traits we used deviations from the mean asymmetry as a measure of developmental instability. Our measures of asymmetry accounted for a moderate proportion of the variance in perceived symmetry. Importantly, only FAs and random deviations from DA contributed to people's perception of symmetry. DA was not important in symmetry judgments. Faces rated as symmetrical were also rated as attractive. Random deviations from DA were weakly related to women's attractiveness judgments of men's faces. DAs did not influence attractiveness judgments. Our data suggest that people focus on aspects of facial asymmetry that may be revealing of developmental instability. Further studies that isolate FA from other forms of asymmetry are required to accurately assess the influence of developmental instability on the quality of individuals and its potential role in mate preferences.","identifiers":{"issn":"14657279","doi":"10.1093\/beheco\/arh099"},"website":"http:\/\/www.beheco.oupjournals.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1093\/beheco\/arh099","stats":{"readers":19,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":79},{"id":22,"name":"Psychology","value":21}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":11},{"name":"Portugal","value":5},{"name":"Canada","value":16}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":42},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":16},{"name":"Senior Lecturer","value":11}]},"issue":"5","pages":"864-871","publication_outlet":"Behavioral Ecology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/are-human-preferences-for-facial-symmetry-focused-on-signals-of-developmental-instability\/","uuid":"5d281520-6d0b-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"L W","surname":"Simmons"}],"title":"Are human preferences for facial symmetry focused on signals of developmental instability?","volume":"15","year":2004,"categories":[411,23,37,43,26],"groups":[{"profile_id":2392281,"date_added":1287061327000,"group_id":478691}],"oa_journal":false},"01e4a200-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"identifiers":{"pmid":"16701309"},"stats":{"readers":198,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":77},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":18},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":3}],"country":[{"name":"Portugal","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":26},{"name":"","value":1}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":37},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":12},{"name":"Post Doc","value":11}]},"issue":"9","type":"Journal Article","publication_outlet":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","publisher":"Elsevier","uuid":"01e4a200-6d01-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"Jessica","surname":"Gurevitch"},{"forename":"Dianna K","surname":"Padilla"}],"title":"Are invasive species a major cause of extinctions?","year":2004,"groups":[{"profile_id":458381,"date_added":1306516876000,"group_id":1152331},{"profile_id":4809871,"date_added":1304548061000,"group_id":1091601},{"profile_id":4731011,"date_added":1304111507000,"group_id":1078511},{"profile_id":3714821,"date_added":1303891313000,"group_id":1070851},{"profile_id":2999671,"date_added":1297800069000,"group_id":883371},{"profile_id":2465011,"date_added":1287371594000,"group_id":592431},{"profile_id":27624,"date_added":1284405033000,"group_id":440691},{"profile_id":137722,"date_added":1259697438000,"group_id":57162},{"profile_id":1698,"date_added":1255454390000,"group_id":19222},{"profile_id":40995,"date_added":1253687513000,"group_id":6103},{"profile_id":40995,"date_added":1253259528000,"group_id":486631}],"oa_journal":false,"abstract":"The link between species invasions and the extinction of natives is widely accepted by scientists as well as conservationists, but available data supporting invasion as a cause of extinctions are, in many cases, anecdotal, speculative and based upon limited observation.

As a case study, I used the distribution patterns of lowland terra firme forest birds. Location Guiana Shield, northern South America. Methods I identified Guianan endemics using the ornithological literature, subsequently gathering distributional data for these taxa using mainly museum collections and my own fieldwork in the region. I used these distributional data to map the spatial patterns of endemicity in the region and to compare distributions across taxa. I employed community composition data from 34 localities from throughout the Guiana Shield to identify spatial patterns of clustering using an ordination analysis (non-metric multidimensional scaling), and to recognize the regions main biogeographical barriers for birds using Monmoniers algorithm. Results At least 88 avian taxa are restricted to the terra firme forests of the Guianan area of endemism, which is roughly delimited by the Amazon, Negro and Branco rivers. These large rivers, however, are not the only boundaries. I identified seven additional barriers, including medium-sized rivers, non-forested areas and mountains, which also contribute to delimiting the area of endemism. Within the endemic avifauna, I identified three distinct distribution patterns. The ordination analysis shows the presence of two distinct avifaunas within the Guiana Shield. Main conclusions Although the proposed boundaries of the Guianan area of endemism are consistent with previously postulated configurations, this study reveals a more complex delimitation than formerly recognized, highlighting the importance of several landscape features besides large rivers, and the existence of three distinct distributional patterns within one endemic avifauna. The Branco\/Negro interfluvium, often included within this area of endemism, actually represents a transition zone between two distinct avifaunas. The longstanding view of the Amazon Basin as a mosaic of parapatric areas of endemism delimited by major rivers appears to be an oversimplification, at least for the Guiana Shield. This finding suggests the need for more rigorous approaches to re-evaluate the traditional boundaries of such areas.","keywords":["areas endemism","biogeography","distributional patterns","endemicity analysis","historical","insects","patagonia","southern south america","steppe"],"website":"http:\/\/www.blackwell-synergy.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2006.01550.x","identifiers":{"issn":"03050270","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2006.01550.x"},"stats":{"readers":56,"discipline":[{"id":3,"name":"Biological Sciences","value":88},{"id":12,"name":"Environmental Sciences","value":11},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":2}],"country":[{"name":"Panama","value":2},{"name":"United States","value":5},{"name":"Portugal","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":27},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":18},{"name":"Post Doc","value":14}]},"issue":"9","pages":"1527-1537","publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/areas-of-endemism-of-the-patagonian-steppe-an-approach-based-on-insect-distributional-patterns-using-endemicity-analysis\/","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","uuid":"c542ef50-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"M","surname":"Cecilia Dominguez"},{"forename":"Sergio","surname":"Roig-Junent"},{"forename":"Juan Jos\u00e9","surname":"Tassin"},{"forename":"Federico C","surname":"Ocampo"},{"forename":"Gustavo E","surname":"Flores"}],"title":"Areas of endemism of the Patagonian steppe: an approach based on insect distributional patterns using endemicity analysis","volume":"33","year":2006,"categories":[34,32,201,203,37,43,40,46,45,425,52,29,210],"oa_journal":false},"983a9d50-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7":{"abstract":"The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) small GTPases regulate vesicular traffic and organelle structure by recruiting coat proteins, regulating phospholipid metabolism and modulating the structure of actin at membrane surfaces.
